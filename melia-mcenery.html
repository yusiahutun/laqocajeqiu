This personality was the hostess of a party organized by Armani.</p><p>Despite the unwanted attention she gained from the media since she started dating Clapton, Melia prefers to stay away from the limelight. Additionally, she has collected a good sum from her profession as a Senior Clinical Advisor. Therefore, working for Crossroads Centre Antigua.</p><h2><span id=Melia_McEnery_8211_Personal_Life>Melia McEnery – Personal Life</span></h2><p>The 22-year-old Melia met musician<strong> Eric Clapton,</strong> who was 53 years old at the time, at a party in Columbus, Ohio, organized by Armani, in the year 1999. Therefore, the party was thrown in honor of Clapton after his performance.</p><p>Reportedly, she had strict orders not to interact with the guests, but she still went up to him to ask for an autograph for her uncle. Moreover, while Clapton had a reputation as a womanizer, he later told the media that he was immediately drawn to her and was determined to act like a gentleman from the first moment.</p><p>And, their meeting went well past the brief introduction as the two became genuinely interested in each other, which prompted them to go out on a dinner date immediately after their first meeting. Despite their huge 31-year age gap, the two soon began dating.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-213315 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Melia-McEnery-USA.jpg alt="Melia McEnery" width=650 height=867 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-213315 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Melia McEnery and Eric’s picture.

But, she ditched him to be with Clapton. Moreover, her ex-boyfriend said in an interview that he had trusted her words and that she and Eric were good friends. But, Eric lured her away by sending limos.</p><p>Incidentally, the two had briefly broken up after a year of dating, due to the stresses of his career. However, in late 2000, reports spread that the two had gotten back together and that they were expecting their first child. Melia gave birth to their first daughter, Julie Rose, named in memory of his late grandmother, on June 13, 2001.</p><p>Likewise, within a week, on June 17, 2001, Eric proposed to her at her family home in Columbus, Ohio, on the occasion of Father’s Day. The two subsequently tied the knot at a low-key church ceremony on January 1st, 2002, at the Chapel of St Mary Magdalene in Ripley, Surrey, Clapton’s birthplace. Further, the guests knew that they were attending the christening ceremony of their six-month-old daughter <a href=#>Julie</a>.</p><p>And, at the same ceremony, Eric’s 16-year-old out-of-wedlock child Ruth Kelly Clapton, his daughter from his relationship with Yvonne Kelly, the manager of AIR Studios, was also baptized. Similarly, they also have two daughters, Ella May (January 14, 2003) and Sophie Belle (February 1st, 2005).</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-213316 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Melia-McEnery.jpeg alt="Melia McEnery" width=650 height=527 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-213316 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Melia McEnery and her daughter Julie.
