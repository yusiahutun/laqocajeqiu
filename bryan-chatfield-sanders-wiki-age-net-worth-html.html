Chatfield throughout the years has managed to make a name for himself as one of the rising stars in the political game.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The Kansas native began his political career as a staff member for Samuel Dale Brownback. From there on he was promoted to the position of Samuel’s Brownback’s press assistant. But then he joined Mike Huckabee’s presidential campaign after Samuel dropped out.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Bryan’s Job & Net Worth</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>As mentioned before, Bryan is an American Republican political consultant who first began his job as a staff member for Samuel Dale Brownback. And later, he was promoted as Samuel’s press assistant. After Samuel dropped out from the campaign, Samuel joined Mike’s Huckabee’s presidential campaign where he met his now wife.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>Interesting:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Erica Peeples Wiki, Age, Husband, Parents" rel=follow>Erica Peeples Wiki, Age, Husband, Parents</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>In 2009, Bryan started a new job as he was hired by the political media firm The Wickers Group. His smart and strategic management resulted in the 2010 Alabama gubernatorial election campaign for Republican Robert J. Bentley. Later in 2012, Bryan started managing the campaign for Ted Yoho who at the time was contesting in Florida’s 3rd District. Bryan created an advertisement called PIGS, which was a hit amongst the political world. He was labeled one of the Rising Stars In American Politics, and his ads were also declared one of the best political ads of the year by the Washington Post. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=603 style="line-height:0;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;display:block!important;min-width:300px;margin-right:auto!important;padding:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;width:728px;min-height:400px;float:none!important;text-align:center!important;max-width:728px"></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Moreover, in 2016, Bryan along with his wife Sarah opened a consulting firm named Second Street Strategies which aims in structuring strategies, research, polling, message development, advertising campaign management, and placement for candidates. The firm currently remains on hold as a result of Sarah’s work as the White House press secretary, but now that it has been announced that Sarah will depart from said position, the firm could start its operations in the coming months.</p><p style=text-align:justify>So when it comes to an understanding of how much is Bryan’s net worth, although the official numbers remain undisclosed, it would be safe to say that the numbers could be in the range of millions. His wife Sarah has a net worth of $1.5 million, and Bryan could possess a similar number as well.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Bryan's Wife Sarah Sanders To Leave The White House!</h2><p style=text-align:justify>In news that has left the public divided in opinions, it was announced the Sarah Sanders is set to leave the White House and her job as the White House Secretary. President Donald Trump confirmed Sarah's news via Twitter. ON 14 June 2019, President confirmed that Sarah would be leaving the White House at the end of this month after three and a half years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=604 style="float:none!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;text-align:center!important;min-height:400px;margin-top:15px!important;margin-right:auto!important;margin-left:auto!important;max-width:728px;padding:0;min-width:300px;line-height:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;display:block!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:728px"></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>After the announcement, Twitter was divided as many accused Sarah of misleading the public on behalf of Trump. Despite such criticisms, Sarah's work in the White House has been appreciated by everyone, including the President himself and will surely be missed in the coming time.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Wedding: Wife, Children</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Bryan Chatfield is a married man.
