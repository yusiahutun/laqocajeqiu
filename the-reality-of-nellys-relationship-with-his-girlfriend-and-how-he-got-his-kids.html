Nelly) struck gold in his music career. Apart from those who had followed his music seven years earlier, he seemed like a happy “guy” out of nowhere. But they could not have been more wrong. The Texas-born star had been involved with hip-hop long before the American music industry got the slightest wind of him. He began his career in 1993, and in the years that followed, the award-winning rapper played on his newfound fame in areas such as fashion, business, Hollywood, and other fields that kept him afloat for the last two decades.</p><p>In addition to his various activities as a musician, actor, and businessman, <a href=#>Nelly</a> is also known for his relationship with Shantel Jackson, Floyd Mayweather’s ex-girlfriend and fiancée. Although he allegedly had a secret relationship with Shantel, it was generally believed that he was the reason Floyd Mayweather broke off their engagement. There is much more to know about the established rapper, and there is no better way to find out than to sit back and let us guide you through the details of Nelly’s love life and relationships.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Understanding Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Her Extraordinary Political Career and Family</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Who Is Nelly Girlfriend And How Did They Meet?</strong></h2><p>Although he hasn’t walked down the aisle yet, Nelly has had other relationships in the past. The rapper has had a romantic relationship with the American actress Shantel Jackson for several years. But how did the two meet?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nellys-Girlfriend.jpg><p>For Shantel Jackson and her lover Floyd Mayweather it was the end of a four-year journey. After several speculations about a possible separation, Jackson revealed in 2014 that their paths had parted. While fans followed the fiasco between the two lovers in social media, their ears were open for the next woman Mayweather would be spotted with. The same was true for Shantel Jackson, of course. Only that there were rumors that she was cheating on her boxing lover, but the question remained, with whom?</p><p>Well, that wasn’t a secret for very long. Vertigo-loving people had spotted Jackson with the hip-hop star at several events. Finally, there was a face to the rumors. But this was just the beginning; the couple would get their fair share of angry critics.</p><p>For Jackson, the aftershocks of their separation from Mayweather had hardly subsided by then. According to sources, the boxer had recovered several expensive items that he had given Jackson during their love trip. In addition to a luxury car and other expensive jewelry, Mayweather demanded money and the $5,000,000 engagement ring he had previously given her.</p><p>For Nelly, there were legal storms from marijuana cases to rape charges. Then there were the media outbursts from other celebrities like 50 Cent, who Mayweather is in some ways sympathetic to. Nonetheless, through thick and thin, the lovebirds have managed to keep things normal, and through their grip on social media, they have managed to create an all-is-well impression.</p><h2><strong>How are They Faring Today?</strong></h2><p>All signs indicate that the fans hope that the rapper will find lasting love in Shantel Jackson. Jackson himself is now taking no more chances. Over the last year or two, the beautiful diva has been sending subliminal messages shouting, “Won’t you marry me already? First, it was an Instagram post in 2016 with a family of three elephants, a father, and a mother with a baby elephant sprinting happily along.</p><p>Another was when she called Nelly and herself “Mr. and Mrs. Adventure” while they were on vacation on the Indonesian island of Bali. Nelly seems to take all the pressure on herself and just strive for the best time to make her union official. If that happens, Shantel Jackson would, of course, adopt his four children.</p><p>Although it is their first time together, both Nelly and Shantell have their individual dating history. For Nelly, it was quite a long journey going back to the year 2000 when he was dating rapper Eve. Their relationship lasted three years before they went their separate ways. In 2002 Nelly is said to have had affairs with Claudia Jordan and former Destiny Child, Kelly Rowland.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Gabourey Sidibe Bio, Weight Loss, Married or Single, Husband, Net Worth</a></strong></p><p>After breaking up with Eve in 2003, Nelly dated R&B star Ashanti from 2003 to 2014. So far it was the longest love affair for the singer. Other women he dated were Lashontae Heckard and Nicole Narain. Nelly also had affairs with Karrine Steffans and Kat Stacks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nelly.jpg><h2><strong>Meet Nelly Kids And Family</strong></h2><figure id=attachment_12958 class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-12958></figure><p>For someone active in love for a long time, it is quite surprising to find out that he is not married yet. Although Nelly has dated many women in the past, none of his relationships could lead to marriage. Nevertheless, the hip-hop star is already a father. He has a total of four children, but they are not all his biological children.</p><p>From 2014 to 2015 Nelly appeared on the reality TV show Nellyville. The show revolves around Nelly’s music and acting career and the challenges of raising his four children. This has led to many fans believing that Nelly is the father of four children. This may be technically true, but only two of them are his biological children. These include a daughter named Chanelle Haynes, born on February 27, 1994, and a son, Cornell Haynes III, born on March 2, 1999.</p><p>Chanelle took after her father as she is now a singer, songwriter, and reality TV star. Cornell, on the other hand, is an athlete who plays for the football team at his school. So far there are no sources with details about her mother. His two other children, Sydney and Shawn, are his niece and nephew, whom he adopted after their mother’s death. While Sydney aspires to be a model one day, Shawn wants to follow in Nelly’s footsteps as a rapper. Together they live in Eureka, Missouri.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kwamxjKucmqSZqcZuu8VmpZ6knK7Abr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2auoqyYYrWqv4ygoKuklqe2prrDZpinnF2dvLh5x55koKekYrWqv4ykoJ2rXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-reality-of-nellys-relationship-with-his-girlfriend-and-how-he-got-his-kids.html&text=The%20Reality%20of%20Nellys%20Relationship%20With%20His%20Girlfriend%20and%20How%20He%20Got%20His%20Kids&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-reality-of-nellys-relationship-with-his-girlfriend-and-how-he-got-his-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-reality-of-nellys-relationship-with-his-girlfriend-and-how-he-got-his-kids.html&title=The%20Reality%20of%20Nellys%20Relationship%20With%20His%20Girlfriend%20and%20How%20He%20Got%20His%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-reality-of-nellys-relationship-with-his-girlfriend-and-how-he-got-his-kids.html&title=The%20Reality%20of%20Nellys%20Relationship%20With%20His%20Girlfriend%20and%20How%20He%20Got%20His%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-reality-of-nellys-relationship-with-his-girlfriend-and-how-he-got-his-kids.html&title=The%20Reality%20of%20Nellys%20Relationship%20With%20His%20Girlfriend%20and%20How%20He%20Got%20His%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-reality-of-nellys-relationship-with-his-girlfriend-and-how-he-got-his-kids.html&description=The%20Reality%20of%20Nellys%20Relationship%20With%20His%20Girlfriend%20and%20How%20He%20Got%20His%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./iheartmedia-fires-two-rochester-djs-for-on-air-racist-comments.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="IHeartMedia Fires Two Rochester DJs For On-Air Racist Comments">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./paris-jackson-harpers-bazaar-interview-michael-jackson-5-revelations.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paris Jackson's 'Sad' Everyone Wants to Talk About Her Dad and 4 Other Revelations From Harper's Baz">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
