Learn about their relationship, along with details on the life of Adam such as age, job & career, parents, and current residence.</p><p>Keep on scrolling this article to learn more about Melanie Rose’s husband.</p><h3><strong>Meet Adam Gascoine, Designer Melanie Rose Husband (Ex)</strong></h3><p>In 2022, Designer Melanie Rose appears single. She was previously married to her ex-husband Adam Gascoine. But their marriage ended before 2018. They likely didn’t share any kids.</p><p>Adam is currently married to his current wife Laura Niemi.</p><p>Melanie is the host of a new Netflix show How To Build A S*x Room. The show premieres on 8 July on Netflix. Each episode follows the deceptively correct and chaste British interior designer as she meets with various couples who discuss s*xual dreams and request that she turn a room in their home into a secret carnal paradise.</p><p>Speaking with The Post, Melanie told, “Darling, I’m the Mary Poppins of s*x rooms”. Her work earned her that name and she justified it by saying, “I’m very English, upper class, as it were. Very classy … don’t dress like a dominatrix”.</p><p>On the show, Melanie visits each couple at home and assesses the space that they want to turn into their s*x room, such as a basement or a spare room. Rose talks about the couple’s goal for the place and its practical aspects before talking about their different quirks and bedtime rituals. A decent s*x room’s secret? She has a variety of s*x toys in her Mary Poppins bag of tricks, including handcuffs and floggers.</p><p>It has been a hot minute since the show premiered and viewers are already wondering if there will be a season 2. The first season has eight episodes of 36 to 45 minutes. Because anything s*x-related sales, it is highly likely there is highly likely a season two for the show on the horizon.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Adam Gascoine Parents?</strong></h3><p><span>Adam Gascoine is the son of the late actress and novelist Jill Gascoine.

She suffered from Alzheimer’s for 10 years, so today was a thankful release. The family is all well and relieved that she’s not suffering anymore”.</span></p><p><span>He added, “</span><span>She was a wonderful human and a spirit of truth and absolute, unconditional love. There was no other. I am happy she’s moved on. Please raise a glass. Be kind and love deeply!”</span></p><p><span>Jill was born on 11 April 1937. She was born and bred in London, England. Jill started her career doing theater in Europe and made her TV debut with a small part in 1958 in the BBC series </span><i><span>Theatre Night</span></i><span>. She was married to Alfred Molina at the time of her death.</span></p><p><span>Alfred labeled Alzheimer’s a “cowardly disease”.&nbsp; </span><span>Whereas, she also had other two children; Rachel Molina and Sean Keith.</span></p><p><span>Jill died at the age of 83 suffering from Alzheimer’s for a number of years. She was living in a care home in Los Angeles.</span></p><p><span>Adam, after his mother’s death, wrote on Facebook, “She suffered from Alzheimer’s for 10 years, so today was a thankful release. The family is all well, and relieved that she’s not suffering anymore”.</span></p><p><span>Her other TV and movie credits included parts in </span><i><span>Z-Cars, General Hospital, Rooms, and Dixon of Dock Green</span></i><span>, before her star turn in </span><i><span>The Gentle Touch</span></i><span> and its spinoff </span><i><span>C.A.T.S Eyes</span></i><span>, as a police officer, then private detective, Maggie Forbes.</span></p><p><span>In April 2018, on Jill’s birthday, Melanie posted on Twitter, “Happy Birthday to my amazing and beautiful former mother-in-law #jillgascoine #thegentletouch”.</span></p><h3><strong>Adam Gascoine Age</strong></h3><p>Adam Gascoine was born in May 1970.
