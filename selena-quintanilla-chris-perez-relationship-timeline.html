A starry-eyed Jesse Posey plays him in the Netflix drama <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a34293355/selena-the-series-news-cast-spoilers-date/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Selena: The Series" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Selena: The Series</a>, and the real Perez was no less swept under her spell. In fact, to this day Perez considers the young singer one of the truest, most important loves of his life.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Looking back, their story seems downright Shakespearean: two star-crossed lovers forced apart by family fury.

Selena's brother, A.B. Quintanilla, had respect for Perez’s artistic ability, but Selena's father, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a34882661/abraham-quintanilla-facts/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Abraham Quintanilla Jr." class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Abraham Quintanilla Jr.</a>, wasn’t sure he trusted Perez’s “image.” Keep in mind that Perez was a rock guitarist, and he had the appearance to match it. Abraham worried that he might tarnish Selena’s otherwise sterling reputation, and therefore her musical career. A.B. pushed for Perez to join the band anyway, and eventually Abraham relented.</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">To Selena, with Love: Commemorative Edition</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$17 at Bookshop for To Selena, with Love: Commemorative Edition" data-href=https://bookshop.org/books/to-selena-with-love-commemorative-edition-commemorative/9780451414069 data-product-url=https://bookshop.org/books/to-selena-with-love-commemorative-edition-commemorative/9780451414069 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=3455358&m=97137&urllink=bookshop.org%2Fbooks%2Fto-selena-with-love-commemorative-edition-commemorative%2F9780451414069&afftrack=har|xid:{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"6f288e17-82b5-40b9-bf1e-141ac706ae78","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","is_active":true,"details":"","metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"2706163","merchant_name":"Bookshop.org","network_name":"SAS","network_id":"1","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","is_active":true,"business_unit_id":"ad046b46-538b-42cb-aa54-c3d158875ed6","details":"","metadata":{},"created_at":"2021-11-04T18:15:18.481570+00:00","last_updated_at":"2021-11-04T18:15:18.481594+00:00"},"product_metadata":{"8b6b0f67-bcde-4d9d-86c6-dedff1abae12":{"link":"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=3455358&m=97137&urllink=bookshop.org%2Fbooks%2Fto-selena-with-love-commemorative-edition-commemorative%2F9780451414069&afftrack={subid}","network_name":"sas","appended_link":"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=3455358&m=97137&urllink=bookshop.org%2Fbooks%2Fto-selena-with-love-commemorative-edition-commemorative%2F9780451414069&afftrack={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2024-01-10 00:49:43.542609"},"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=3455358&m=97137&urllink=bookshop.org%2Fbooks%2Fto-selena-with-love-commemorative-edition-commemorative%2F9780451414069&afftrack={subid}","network_name":"sas","appended_link":"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=3455358&m=97137&urllink=bookshop.org%2Fbooks%2Fto-selena-with-love-commemorative-edition-commemorative%2F9780451414069&afftrack={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2024-01-10 02:31:01.333437"},"530bacd4-96b2-4cfe-a9a6-1fbd7c749e22":{"link":"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=3455358&m=97137&urllink=bookshop.org%2Fbooks%2Fto-selena-with-love-commemorative-edition-commemorative%2F9780451414069&afftrack={subid}","network_name":"sas","appended_link":"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=3455358&m=97137&urllink=bookshop.org%2Fbooks%2Fto-selena-with-love-commemorative-edition-commemorative%2F9780451414069&afftrack={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2024-01-10 05:09:17.420222"}}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$17 at Bookshop" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://bookshop.org/books/to-selena-with-love-commemorative-edition-commemorative/9780451414069 data-vars-ga-product-brand=Celebra data-vars-ga-product-id=89e03d45-a637-4458-9719-b1f65d7f8683 data-vars-ga-product-price=$16.74 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=9e512d7a-b7dc-4864-96fc-325d534e4a1b data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=Celebra data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=International data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=bookshop_9780451414069 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="To Selena, with Love: Commemorative Edition" title="To Selena, with Love: Commemorative Edition" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1607013332-9780451414069.jpg width=265 height=400 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">To Selena, with Love: Commemorative Edition</h2></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As they started working together, Perez and Selena noticed a budding attraction, despite the fact that Perez was taken—he had a girlfriend back home in San Antonio.

Furious, Abraham told Perez to end it, but he refused, continuing the romance à la Romeo and Juliet—in secret. But when Abraham eventually found out, he threatened to disband the group unless Selena removed Perez from the equation. Devastated, Perez retreated. Abraham fired him, and Perez fled home, where he quietly kept in touch with Selena as her stardom amplified.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I saw him as a threat," Abraham said of Chris to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/dreaming-of-her/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Texas Monthly" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Texas Monthly</a> years ago. "What if they got married and he pulled her out of the band? All the work we did all those years would go down the tubes."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"[It] kind of hurt his pride and his ego to find out that he was the last to know," Chris said of Selena's father in a 2012 interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/chris-perez-selena-book/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CNN class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">CNN</a>, "and when things got tense and things were said by him, it hurt me that he was saying it but I didn't let it get to me because I knew deep down he knew the kind of person I was."</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">They eloped in 1992.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Flash-forward to a fateful morning in 1992, when Selena appeared at Perez’s hotel door and demanded to see him. She couldn’t keep living apart from him, she said, but she knew Abraham would never approve of their relationship, let alone a wedding. Solution? Elopement. "I was thinking, 'Oh, my God, we're doing this. Oh, my God, what are we doing? Oh, my God!' The next thing I knew, it was over and we had been pronounced man and wife," Perez recalled.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The two were married that same year, and though they wished to keep the news a secret, the media announced their union almost immediately. Of course, Abraham was less than thrilled to have been kept in the dark, but he ultimately accepted Perez. "After that, I accepted him as part of the family. What else could I do?" he told Texas Monthly. Selena and Perez moved into a house right next to the rest of the Quintanilla family. <strong></strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The marriage between Selena and Perez was passionate but not perfect. Perez admitted in his CNN interview that they had fought and even considered divorce. “We were married and together 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We had to learn how to handle that and that was both of us. It's not like she brought up the idea and I was fighting it because honestly I was right there with her.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But they resolved their conflict and had started talking about having a baby shortly before tragedy struck.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Chris continues to honor Selena after her death.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On March 31, 1995, Selena’s fan club president, Yolanda Saldívar, shot the singer in the back after a dispute about alleged embezzlement. Selena, then just 23 years old, later died at the hospital, two days before her third wedding anniversary with Perez. Decades later, Perez said that her death still shocks him. He told <u><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.etonline.com/selena-quintanillas-husband-chris-perez-remembers-the-first-time-he-laid-eyes-on-the-late-singer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Tonight" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Entertainment Tonight</a></u> in 2018, “There are times where it feels like you can pick up the phone and call her.

He says the marriage was, in one sense, an attempt to get over Selena's death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When I got remarried, that was me trying to downplay [Selena’s death] in my life," Perez told the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nypost.com/2020/12/17/selena-husband-chris-perez-talks-love-25-years-after-death/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New York Post" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">New York Post</a>. "It was too painful. I never talked about [Selena’s death]. Getting remarried and starting my new life was a way to get over losing her. I thought getting remarried would help, and it did. But the pain is still there. It’ll always be there.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even years after the death of his first love, he said that Selena still inspires him constantly. As her legacy continues in both her music and in this new Netflix show, Perez said that he believes her story will resound with young people for generations to come.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He even spoke highly of the new release, fondly recalling his days with Selena y Los Dinos. “I will forever respect the band and the people involved in it.

"You can line us all up, the guys in the band and the members of her family, and ask us to tell the full story of all the things we experienced together, and it’d be the same story but told from a bunch of different perspectives," he said. "And [Selena: The Series] is their perspective."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He later revealed that the relationship between him and Selena's family continues to be fraught: "“I’m a believer that if you truly ever did love somebody you don’t just stop loving them.
