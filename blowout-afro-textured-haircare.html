On dry hair, use Design Essential's Scalp and Skin Care Vitamin Drops as the ultimate finisher. This formula nourishes and moisturizes your scalp keeping your hair healthy as the summer heats up. Vitamin A and D3 also work together to restore hair strand by strand to its full glory.

"Due to the volume and textures in natural hair most people think that our hair is more resilient than other hair textures — while in reality, textured hair is most delicate in nature and requires more TLC," says the stylist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's why we asked Eaddy and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>David Lopez</a>, celebrity stylist and T3 ambassador, to share everything you should know before blowing out natural hair. Follow their steps below.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-start-with-fresh-clean-conditioned-strands></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Start With Fresh, Clean, Conditioned Strands</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To prepare your hair for a blowout, you'll want to start with freshly shampooed hair that has been deep conditioned. "Whilst shampooing and conditioning your hair, it's important to make sure you are thoroughly cleansing the hair and rinsing out oils and product buildup, as this can affect the quality of your blowout and can lead to heat damage," says Eaddy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A conditioning treatment is like the icing on the cake of any shampoo, if you want to treat your stands to extra nutrients and hydration, it's a must. According to Eaddy, deep conditioning your hair before a blowout will give you optimal results. "Not only does a deep condition before a blowout give you a smoother finish, it helps to improve hair elasticity and combat breakage from the heat process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And if you want to give your hair some extra oomph, add in some steam — literally.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A deep conditioning treatment with a hair steamer is one of my favorite hair care rituals and pro-tips for the best blowout for natural hair, especially if you are experiencing breakage of any sort," adds Eaddy. "Hair steaming ensures that your hair absorbs the maximum amount of hydration and moisture possible which also helps to increase elasticity and prevent breakage."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-detangle-your-stands></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Detangle Your Stands</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Knotted, tangled hair will not fare well during the blowout process — trust me on this one. Thoroughly detangling your hair helps with retention, especially for those with tighter curls and textures, as you avoid tangles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have hair that gets knotty easily, the detangling process can be made easier with moisturizing products, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Juice & Botanics Juicy Smooth Detangling Conditioner</a>, which work to ease any knots — so there's no need to ever tug at your tresses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eaddy recommends pre-detangling dry hair with your fingers to help remove any shedding hairs, then detangling the hair again once it's wet and you've applied conditioner. "After shampooing the hair at least two times, section the hair, apply your conditioner and detangle each section," says the stylist. "Use a detangling brush to comb through your stands, working from the root of your hair to the tip. I prefer using detangling brushes over wide-tooth combs because they remove shedding hairs that have been intertwining with your strands in-between wash days."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-apply-a-leave-in-conditioner></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Apply a Leave-in Conditioner</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Always use a leave-in conditioner before applying your heat protectants," says Eaddy — who recommends using both a liquid and cream leave-in to provide optimal nourishment and support to the hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Juice & Botanics Replenishing Leave-In Conditioning Spray</a> strengthens and restores hair with ultra-lightweight moisture from root to tip," says the stylist. "Not only does this revitalizing rice protein formula provide a wealth of shine and instant detangling, but it also improves hair elasticity, manageability, and luster."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I also like to apply <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Juice & Botanics The Quench Cream Fortifying Leave-In Conditioner</a> as it's crucial to treat the hair with something nourishing after you rinse out the conditioner," she adds. "This leave-in conditioner works to lock in hydration and moisture while also protecting the hair from environmental factors that can be very damaging. It's very lightweight and helps fight against frizz, all while working to improve the health and condition of the hair, to promote healthy locks and length retention."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-use-a-heat-protectant></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Use a Heat Protectant</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Heat protectants do exactly what they say on the bottle — protect your hair from the heat. Regardless of whether you're doing a DIY blowout, or you're going to a professional, this is a step that should not be missed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Heat protectants are designed to form a protective barrier between your styling tools and your hair, they also help to seal in moisture and fend off flyaways.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Heat protectants help prevent hair breakage and minimize damage that can be caused by thermal tools," says Eaddy. "I always like to layer my thermal protectant with a serum like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Silk Essentials Thermal Strengthening Serum</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Kendra Professional Blow Dry Midst</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>MoroccanOil Protect & Prevent Spray</a>, for extra measure."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Dealing With Dry Natural Hair?

Yes, it takes more time but the results are worth it. Not only will your hair be easier to control, but you'll avoid creating a tangled mess.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When sectioning off the hair after applying leave-in and thermal protection, I like to create Bantu knots or small buns and secure them with hair clips," says Eaddy. "This helps to keep the hair stretched and locks in the moisture from the leave-in conditioners and heat protectants."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-use-a-comb-or-paddle-brush></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Use a Comb or Paddle Brush</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To achieve a flat, sleek blowout, Eaddy says she swears by using a blow dryer with comb attachment for optimal straightening power and more controlled styling. "Blow dryers with a comb attachment also cut down on drying time dramatically," explains the stylist. "There are some great budget-friendly blow dryers with comb attachments, buf if you want something more luxurious, I would definitely opt for the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Dyson Supersonic™ Hair Dryer</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking to achieve a bouncy, smooth blowout with lots of volume, it's best to blowout your hair with a brush using the pull-and-roll technique. Once your hair is 60% dry, you can begin the popular technique by blowing out your hair with a round brush. You still want to work in small sections to keep the hair under control and to prevent heat damage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Begin blow drying at the root of your hair and brush it tightly. Move your hair brush slowly toward the end of your hair, following the direction of the hair dryer. Make sure you point the nozzle of the hair dryer downward toward the ends of your hair to ensure the hair dries smoothly and frizz-free. As you approach the end of your hair, roll the hair brush toward the root and pull it back toward the end. Repeat this technique until your hair is completely dry and finish by blasting the roots of your hair with cold air to get a lovely lift at the roots, and help the hair cool.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you struggle with the pull-and-roll technique, Lopez recommends trying the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>T3 AireBrush Duo</a> with the round brush or paddle brush attachment. It's basically a hairdryer and a brush in one, so it makes life a lot easier, especially when doing a blowout.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-long-does-a-blowout-last></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Long Does a Blowout Last?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Typically blowouts can last you anywhere from one to five days, with some lasting as long as ten days. It really depends on your hair type, says Lopez. "Dry hair types that don't get oily very quickly will last a lot longer."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-way-to-maintain-a-blowout></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Best Way to Maintain a Blowout?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The best way to maintain a blowout is to avoid water at all costs," says Lopez. If the slightest bit of water touches your perfected blowout, it will reverse your hard work.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eaddy also recommends avoiding water-based hair products or applying too much oil to the hair, as both can react with humectants in the hair and cause frizziness.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-way-to-sleep-with-a-blowout></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's The Best Way to Sleep With a Blowout?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want your blowout to last through a few bedtime naps, both Eaddy and Lopez recommend sleeping with a silk head wrap and using a silk pillowcase to help reduce friction and eliminate frizz.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>You Go Natural's Pleated Sleep Turbans</a> because they are lined with silk and versatile enough to wear fashionably," says Eaddy. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Damn Gina Damn Good Silk Pillowcases</a> are not just great for the ultimate beauty sleep, but they are made from 100% mulberry silk, which will help to keep your blowout intact. .</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lopez also recommends a great touch-up tool to give your blowout a burst of life if it looks limp or frizzy in the morning. "I like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>T3 Edge</a> heated, smoothing, styling brush," says the stylist. "It's great to make sure you keep up the smooth finish of the blowout for day two hair and beyond."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-often-should-you-do-a-blowout></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Often Should You Do a Blowout?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Blowouts are a great way to stretch and style natural hair but they shouldn't be overdone. Heat is something that you'll want to keep to a minimum to preserve the health of your strands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I typically advise my clients not to do a blowout more than every four, six, or even eight weeks, if possible," says Eaddy. "Depending upon the current health and state of your hair, spacing out your blowouts will help to preserve the natural texture of your hair. I also recommend air drying your hair before doing a blowout at home, it's a great way to minimize direct heat."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lopez says that your lifestyle and how important maintaining your curl pattern is, are also things to consider. "It's totally up to your personal preference as well as how sensitive your hair is to heat," says the stylist.
