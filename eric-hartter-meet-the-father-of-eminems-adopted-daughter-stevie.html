For those unfamiliar with this name, he gained media attention not for his achievements but for his connection to rap mogul Eminem and his ex-wife, Kim Mathers. Hartter gained notoriety after Eminem adopted his biological daughter.</p><p>Here’s a deeper look into the tattoo artist’s life, his intricate web of relationships, the lesser-known facts about his life, and his relationship with his daughter, Stevie Laine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Was_Eric_Hartter></span>Who Was Eric Hartter?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eric Hartter was a professional tattoo artist born in Roseville, Michigan, USA, in 1980. However, his exact birth date eludes the media. Although he gained media attention before his death, most details about his early life remain undisclosed. He rose to prominence primarily for being the biological father of Stevie Laine, whom Eminem later adopted.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the mystery that surrounded his life, Hartter had a good talent. He was a dedicated tattoo artist, but unfortunately, he was equally known for his involvement in drug peddling under the guise of his tattoo establishment. Those who knew him personally often spoke of the duality of his nature, a skilled artist trapped in a cycle of destructive decisions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-28_20-02-25-fotor-2023082820719.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Did_Eric_Hartter_Do_for_a_Living></span>What Did Eric Hartter Do for a Living?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hartter’s primary profession was as a tattoo artist. Over the years, he mastered his craft, etching intricate designs onto the skin of many satisfied customers, thereby making a living through this art.</p><p>However, parallelly, he ran a drug peddling business. Unfortunately, this darker side of his life overshadowed his legitimate career and often landed him in situations that spiraled into trouble.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Eric_Hartters_Babymama></span>Who Is Eric Hartter’s Babymama?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eric Hartter’s baby mama, Kim Mathers, was born Kimberly Scott to her parents on January 9, 1975, in Warren, Michigan, United States. According to reports, Kim’s father was an alcoholic and abusive. Consequently, she and her twin sister, Dawn Scott, grew up with their mother and stepdad.&nbsp;</p><p>Hartter’s baby mama attended Lincoln High School in the United States before running away from home as a teenager. In 1987, Kim got into a romantic relationship with rapper Eminem, and she moved into his mother’s house with her twin sister. At the time, the twins were only 15 years old. On December 25, 1995, the duo had their daughter Hailie Jade.&nbsp;</p><p>Although their relationship was turbulent, they ignored all the signs and tied the knot in 1999. However, the marriage did not last long, and it ended with a divorce in 2001, after which Kim met Eric Hartter, and they started dating. During their brief time together, the then-couple had Stevie Laine.</p><p>However, after their brief stint, Kim returned to her ex-husband with her daughter, Stevie Laine. Eminem and Kim decided to give their marriage a trial again, and in January 2006, they tied the knot for the second time. However, their second marriage was even shorter than the first, lasting one month before they filed for divorce.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-28_20-12-18-fotor-20230828201320.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Eric_Hartter_Ever_Get_Married></span>Did Eric Hartter Ever Get Married?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eric Hartter never tied the knot officially. His most notable romantic relationship was with Kim Mathers, Eminem’s ex-wife. Beyond this relationship, there is a shroud of mystery surrounding his life. There is little information about his romantic endeavors or if he had any other significant relationships or children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_to_Eric_Hartter></span>What Happened to Eric Hartter?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tragically, Eric Hartter’s life was cut short due to drug-related complications. In a sad culmination of a life marred by addiction, he was found dead in an abandoned house in Detroit, Michigan, on August 22, 2019. Autopsy results pointed towards a possible overdose from a deadly cocktail of cocaine and fentanyl. Afterward, his mother cremated him on September 11, 2019.</p><p>Eric battled with his demons throughout his life, having been in and out of prison multiple times. After his jail term, he faced charges related to drug possession, particularly fentanyl and methamphetamine. Consequently, he received a jail term of 153 days with 24 months of probation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/stevie.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Is_Stevie_Laine></span>Where Is Stevie Laine?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eric Hartter’s daughter, <a href=#>Stevie Laine</a>, was born on April 16, 2002. Eminem stepped into her life early on, adopting her in 2005 after the relationship between her parents fell apart. Growing up in Eminem’s household, she always believed him to be her biological father until a revelation in 2019 upended her understanding of her parentage.&nbsp;</p><p>Stevie’s journey into self-discovery continued as she made headlines again in 2021, coming out as non-binary. Like rapper <a href=#>Lil Uzi Vert</a>, she now prefers to be referred to by the pronoun ‘they.” Consequently, they use their platform on various social media platforms to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and share their experiences with identity and self-acceptance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksrO1wmafmqqkqbKzecyenK1lpJ2ybrLArZ%2Beql2ks26xzKKlnqWjYq6lu8%2BtnJ1llJbCqLTTnqlmq6Saw6qxjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2feric-hartter-meet-the-father-of-eminems-adopted-daughter-stevie.html&text=Eric%20Hartter%3a%20Meet%20the%20Father%20of%20Eminems%20Adopted%20Daughter%20Stevie&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feric-hartter-meet-the-father-of-eminems-adopted-daughter-stevie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2feric-hartter-meet-the-father-of-eminems-adopted-daughter-stevie.html&title=Eric%20Hartter%3a%20Meet%20the%20Father%20of%20Eminems%20Adopted%20Daughter%20Stevie" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2feric-hartter-meet-the-father-of-eminems-adopted-daughter-stevie.html&title=Eric%20Hartter%3a%20Meet%20the%20Father%20of%20Eminems%20Adopted%20Daughter%20Stevie" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2feric-hartter-meet-the-father-of-eminems-adopted-daughter-stevie.html&title=Eric%20Hartter%3a%20Meet%20the%20Father%20of%20Eminems%20Adopted%20Daughter%20Stevie" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feric-hartter-meet-the-father-of-eminems-adopted-daughter-stevie.html&description=Eric%20Hartter%3a%20Meet%20the%20Father%20of%20Eminems%20Adopted%20Daughter%20Stevie" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./m-pokora-christina-milian-married-dating-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="M.
