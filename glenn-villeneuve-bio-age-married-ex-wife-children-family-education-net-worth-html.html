I’ve gone as long as 4 ½ months without seeing anyone, and that is much too long for my taste! I enjoy this lifestyle even more when I’ve got someone to share it with. At the moment, I don’t. I don’t have any regrets, though. I like to spend time in Fairbanks, but I love the wilderness. That’s where I belong."</p><p style=text-align:justify>The National Geographic Channel documented the life of Glenn in the&nbsp;remote&nbsp;mountains of Arctic Alaska,<span style=background-color:#fff;color:#262626;font-family:nhg-roman,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;font-size:16px>&nbsp;</span>and the earning from the show which averages $71,000 annually&nbsp;must have added a significant amount to his net worth, which, at the moment, remains confined.
