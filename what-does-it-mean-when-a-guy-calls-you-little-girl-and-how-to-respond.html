You can smile, laugh, touch him back, and compliment him as well. You can also call him by a cute nickname, such as big boy, handsome, or sweetheart.

He might use this term as a way of expressing his anger, contempt, or disrespect for you. He might also want to hurt your feelings, belittle you, or intimidate you.</p><p>If he calls you little girl in a harsh and rude tone, while frowning, glaring, or shouting, then he is probably insulting you.

You can be firm and assertive, but avoid being aggressive or defensive. You can also stand up for yourself and confront him.
