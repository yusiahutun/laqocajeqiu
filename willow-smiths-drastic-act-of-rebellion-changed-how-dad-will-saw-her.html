His press tour included the intimate event, Will Smith: An Evening of Stories with Friends, in New York City, during which he opened up about his youngest child and only daughter, Willow.</p><p>Born October 31, 2000, Willow entered the spotlight acting alongside her father in I Am Legend in 2007. But it was her debut single, Whip My Hair, that solidified the then-10-year-old as a star in her own right. The <a href=#>music</a> release led to a gig as Justin Bieber’s supporting tour act, and it was around the same time she chose to shave her head bald.</p><p>At the time, Will believed he was “doing really, really well as a father,” but his daughter’s act of rebellion made him realize she was overworked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6>When Willow completed her tour performance, she told Will: “Thank you, Daddy. I’m finished.” Smith proceeded to tell her that she had to continue performing, to which she replied: “It doesn’t matter to you that I’m done, Daddy?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8>One morning, Willow “shaved her entire head bald,” and recognized that he had disregarded her feelings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8>“I’m looking and I’m like, ‘Got it. I got it, baby. I’m sorry. I apologize. You can stop,'” he said. “It was terrifying. I felt like I had been texting looking at my phone and stepped out into the street in front of a bus and Willow snatched me back.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8>Will continued: “As strange as it sounds, at that moment I discovered feelings. I had to really think about the question she was asking me. The question she was really asking was ‘Daddy, does it matter to you how I feel?’ It was so explosive in my mind. That was like a deep, existential question.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12>“My parenting style changed in that moment,” he recalled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1445905771-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-willow-admits-shaving-her-head-was-the-most-radical-thing>Willow admits shaving her head was ‘the most radical thing’</h2><p>The then-pint-size popstar was known for long braided locks that perfectly accompanied her hair-whipping track, but in 2023, a buzzcut became Willow’s signature style.</p><p>Aside from her frustrations of being overworked, the Wait A Minute singer admitted that she kept the style because she enjoys seeing a “glare” on her scalp as the light bounces off her fresh cut.</p><p>“Shaving my head is maybe the most radical thing I’ve done in the name of beauty,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Glamour. But as a fashion chameleon, Willow has become a representation of women who live as their authentic selves.</p><p>“My only goal is to embody pure love and acceptance,” she explained. “And to inspire other people to find that place within themselves, and do the same.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2h%2BcMPIpaOor12ouqrAx6xknaqRqMGqr4yamq1ln5t6s7HBnqOloZ%2BjeqS0wKeenpxdnby4ecOam2avmaG5br%2FAsGShnaJk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwillow-smiths-drastic-act-of-rebellion-changed-how-dad-will-saw-her.html&text=Willow%20Smith%27s%20drastic%20act%20of%20rebellion%20struck%20her%20dad%20Will%20with%20terror&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwillow-smiths-drastic-act-of-rebellion-changed-how-dad-will-saw-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwillow-smiths-drastic-act-of-rebellion-changed-how-dad-will-saw-her.html&title=Willow%20Smith%27s%20drastic%20act%20of%20rebellion%20struck%20her%20dad%20Will%20with%20terror" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwillow-smiths-drastic-act-of-rebellion-changed-how-dad-will-saw-her.html&title=Willow%20Smith%27s%20drastic%20act%20of%20rebellion%20struck%20her%20dad%20Will%20with%20terror" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwillow-smiths-drastic-act-of-rebellion-changed-how-dad-will-saw-her.html&title=Willow%20Smith%27s%20drastic%20act%20of%20rebellion%20struck%20her%20dad%20Will%20with%20terror" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwillow-smiths-drastic-act-of-rebellion-changed-how-dad-will-saw-her.html&description=Willow%20Smith%27s%20drastic%20act%20of%20rebellion%20struck%20her%20dad%20Will%20with%20terror" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./my-journey-to-you-ending.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title>&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-to-do-with-leftover-coffee-grounds.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What To Do With Leftover Coffee Grounds: 13 Brilliant Uses">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
