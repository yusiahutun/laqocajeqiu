The pair tied the knot in 1996, and share three daughters: Alexia, 27, Sophia, 24, and Portia, 16. (Mauricio is stepdad to Farrah, 35, from Kyle's previous marriage to Guraish Aldjufrie.) However, last year, the two confirmed rumors that they're experiencing a rough patch in their marriage and had separated.</p><p>But Miller told TooFab that not all hope is lost. She said she doesn't see the two breaking up, but shared that the couple may need to make some changes, including Mauricio giving Kyle "more attention."</p><p>"They're a piece of work. ... Some people don't know when they have it good. He is a Cancer," Miller said of Mauricio, whose birthday is June 25. "Family is everything to him. And he does not wanna be an uncle to his children. He wants to be there."</p><p>"She's a Capricorn, and she's practical," she added of Kyle, who was born on January 11, 1969. "I don't think she's going to find anybody more compatible than [him]."</p><p>The Astrology Zone founder went on to note that Kyle is a Leo rising. (While your sun sign reflects your identity and true self, your rising sign -- also known as your ascendant sign -- <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>represents </strong></a>"the characteristics you adopt at birth and express naturally.")</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"Leo loves the fun of love, loves the chase, and the compliments. Now, if he's been busy with other things, she may feel she's not getting enough attention," Miller said, before adding that Kyle's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Venus </strong></a>-- the planet of love and affection -- is in Pisces, "which is the most loving, giving place possible."</p><p>"We call it exalted in Pisces," she continued. "She is really very kind, and giving, very giving."</p><p>Meanwhile, as for Mauricio, Miller emphasized his sun and moon sign, along with his placements in Venus and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-planets/jupiter/><strong>Jupiter</strong></a>, the planet of good fortune.</p><p>"He is a Cancer. Cancers will do anything to hold a marriage together," she told TooFab. "He has Jupiter in Libra. He loves being married. It's in the house of home and family."</p><p>"His Venus is in Leo. ... She has Leo rising," she continued, adding, "He loves her. I don't think they're going to break up."</p><p>"He has the moon in Pisces," Miler went on to note, referencing Mauricio's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>moon sign</strong></a>,<strong> </strong>which reflects your emotions and personality. "And she has Venus in Pisces. Oh, come on. Come on kids. You have to stop fighting. I mean, you're so good together. There's so much mutual trust."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8007b583-e633-468b-91cd-754c3ffa60c9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:61cbafa8-b2d1-4da8-8be2-5765609b5088 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8f/5by4/2024/02/13/8f0536947c3e4284a0f21b37ea932a07_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky Discuss 'Challenging' Year on RHOBH Before Finale Bombshell</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>When asked for more information as to why she's confident the two will stay together, Miller said, "There's too much glue here. And they really share the value of taking care of family."</p><p>She also indirectly addressed the rumors of infidelity that have long plagued their marriage, stating that she doesn't believe Mauricio has been unfaithful.</p><p>"I don't think he's fooling around," Miller told TooFab. "I don't think he's seeing anybody else. Cancer doesn't do that. He's loyal."</p><p>As for how they can fix their marriage, Miller said she believes Kyle and Mauricio need to add "stimulation" and "excitement" into their relationship, suggesting that maybe going on a vacation together could help rekindle their romance.</p><p>"I guess they've been married like 27 years. [Kyle] needs stimulation," she explained. "I would love them to take a wonderful trip together to someplace they've never been, someplace they could really look around. Explore like Kyoto or Istanbul or someplace they haven't been. They've probably been everywhere, but maybe there's a place they haven't been. They need something to rejuvenate the connection."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"I think she feels she's had it all. She had the love. She had the children. She has the house. She has the security, but she wants a little more attention. And that's normal," Miller continued. "A lot of people feel that way if their husband's busy, and if they've been married a long time, they have to find a way to inject some excitement."</p><p>"They just need a little spark of rejuvenation," she added.</p><p>Ultimately, Miller expressed that she's adamant that the couple will make it work.</p><p>"Look, they're going to stay together," she said. "They're not going to break up. Maybe they just need a little time apart. I think she wants him to miss her. I do not think he's fooling around. I don't. I feel he's loyal to her. And he loves the children."</p><p>Rumors that Kyle and Mauricio had split began in the summer. Following the reports, Kyle and Mauricio <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>released a joint statement on Instagram in July</strong></a>, in which the couple admitted they were having marital troubles and had a "rough year," but reports of them getting a divorce were "untrue."</p><p>In the months that followed, the pair -- who continue to live under the same roof -- have stressed that they are working through their issues amid their separation. (During BravoCon in November, Kyle <a href=#><strong>used the word "divorce"</strong></a> during an interview with TooFab, before later claiming that she meant to say "separated.")</p><p>The rift between Kyle and Mauricio has been evidenced in Season 13 of RHOBH, with Mauricio noticeably absent, while Kyle honored her late friend, Lorene Shea, on the first anniversary of her death, and Kyle rumored to be getting cozy with musician, Morgan Wade.</p><p>Meanwhile, last month, Kyle <a href=#><strong>celebrated her 55th birthday in Mexico</strong></a>, but Mauricio wasn't anywhere in sight.</p><a id=gallery-link-8e52d0aa-a01b-4d46-a378-8e165324fb4a class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:8e52d0aa-a01b-4d46-a378-8e165324fb4a data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:61cbafa8-b2d1-4da8-8be2-5765609b5088 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/57/4by3/2024/02/13/573fae13a27d44a796a61b6f2ad60a5b_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tmam5flsC1vs6lpqCdomLAtr%2FAp2SmoZyhsrN51p6goKCjYravecqyo55lop6wqa3RnapmpZGqv6qvyKhkrqWRo8CsxYydoK%2BnopiybrHXnKOuq5mrsnA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fastrologer-susan-miller-weighs-in-kyle-richards-mauricio-umansky-divorce-exclusive.html&text=Will%20Kyle%20Richards%20%26amp%3b%20Mauricio%20Umansky%20Divorce%20or%20Reconcile%3f%20Astrologer%20Susan%20Miller%20Weighs%20In&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fastrologer-susan-miller-weighs-in-kyle-richards-mauricio-umansky-divorce-exclusive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fastrologer-susan-miller-weighs-in-kyle-richards-mauricio-umansky-divorce-exclusive.html&title=Will%20Kyle%20Richards%20%26amp%3b%20Mauricio%20Umansky%20Divorce%20or%20Reconcile%3f%20Astrologer%20Susan%20Miller%20Weighs%20In" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fastrologer-susan-miller-weighs-in-kyle-richards-mauricio-umansky-divorce-exclusive.html&title=Will%20Kyle%20Richards%20%26amp%3b%20Mauricio%20Umansky%20Divorce%20or%20Reconcile%3f%20Astrologer%20Susan%20Miller%20Weighs%20In" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fastrologer-susan-miller-weighs-in-kyle-richards-mauricio-umansky-divorce-exclusive.html&title=Will%20Kyle%20Richards%20%26amp%3b%20Mauricio%20Umansky%20Divorce%20or%20Reconcile%3f%20Astrologer%20Susan%20Miller%20Weighs%20In" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fastrologer-susan-miller-weighs-in-kyle-richards-mauricio-umansky-divorce-exclusive.html&description=Will%20Kyle%20Richards%20%26amp%3b%20Mauricio%20Umansky%20Divorce%20or%20Reconcile%3f%20Astrologer%20Susan%20Miller%20Weighs%20In" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bhavna-vaswani.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bhavna Vaswani Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sippy-sujan-balancing-work-and-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sippy Sujan: Thriving in Balancing Succes of Work and Life | ITCAN">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
