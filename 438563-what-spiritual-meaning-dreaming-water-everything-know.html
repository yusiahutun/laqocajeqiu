But the scientific revelations of the late 19th and early 21st centuries tell a different story. As it turns out, your brain is engaged in several activities closely linked to the quality of life. Among these are dreams, which of course, have been well known since the beginning of time. Moreover, since ancient times, it was believed that dreams bring particular messages.

However, during the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep cycle, you achieve this state whereby your brain ordinarily paralyses your muscles, so you don't act out on your dreams.</p><p class=align-left>But have you ever wondered about the meaning of your dreams? For example, what if your dream has water; does it represent something? Water in a dream is open to various interpretations as it is the basis of all life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f92a7375fca21db2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dreaming about someone trying to hurt you? What it means</span></p></a><h2>What is the spiritual meaning of dreaming about water?</h2><p class=align-left>Water is perhaps the most valuable element on earth and significant to human life. The element possesses immeasurable biological, physical, spiritual and symbolic value. Therefore, it is pretty troublesome to have the essential commodity in your dream.</p><p class=align-left>In Biblical terms, water is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">essence of life and a powerful destroyer</a>. Therefore, it has been utilised as a metaphor in the Bible and other religious texts. So, what does water mean in a dream spiritually?</p><h3>Tailored to prosper</h3><p class=align-left>Since water is known to give life to everything on earth, dreaming about it in your dream can signify that you are geared to thrive. And it can indicate significant progress in your personal life, professional life or both.</p><p class=align-left>So, it is a good idea to look closely at the changes happening in your life. Maybe your boss at work sees great potential in you and is looking to give you a promotion. You might be on your way to climbing the corporate ladder.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/53ed652295adc9e5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does dreaming that someone is pregnant actually mean?</span></p></a><h3>Start of a new beginning</h3><p class=align-left>Water is a sign of cleansing, and if it is in your dream, it might symbolise a new beginning. Therefore, it is upon you to reflect on running your life and figure out if you need a fresh start in a particular area.</p><h3>3. Growth opportunities</h3><p class=align-left>Having water in your dream can <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">symbolise growth opportunities</a>. It represents how you handle your unconscious or conscious feelings, whether the dream was a nightmare or something soft. If you turn to your deepest reservoirs of emotion, you can learn how to deal with your feelings, leading to growth and freedom.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, if you dream about water and are afraid of going close to it, you might feel intimidated by deep emotions and avoid close <a href=#>relationships</a>.</p><h3>Place of serenity</h3><p class=align-left>If you are dreaming about being in a pool for a long time and are lying there calmly to refresh your body, mind and spirit, it can mean you are in a place of serenity. The water in your dream symbolises comfort and reminds you to stay in tune with your mood and make the necessary changes in your life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ebd0be759f3e2e8b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ best African proverbs about life, hard times, and death</span></p></a><h3>Sign of being limitless</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f92a7375fca21db2.jpeg><p class=align-left>If you have been wondering about the Biblical meaning of ocean in dreams, you will be glad to know that it symbolises being limitless. Water covers 70% of the earth, and whenever you gaze over the ocean, you can hardly see anything past your eye’s range.</p><p class=align-left>Such a dream <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">signifies limitless power</a> and means having a positive mindset, which is a great thing. Also, it shows that you are open to new challenges that you consider will bring success and help define and realise your goals.</p><h3>Negative emotions and worries</h3><p class=align-left>If you have dreamt about impure water in your dream, it might symbolise negative emotions and worry that surround you in your life. Most people with numerous fears often dream about muddy water because they have an unclean conscience.</p><p class=align-left>Also, it can mean that you are misunderstood and rejected in your life, especially when you fall into muddy water. Such <a href=#>dreams remind people</a> not to let the negatives in their lives keep them behind and always move forward.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1c8fb59f0e2d6606.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ best graduation captions to share on your Instagram</span></p></a><h3>Take control of your emotions</h3><p class=align-left>If you have wondered about the Biblical meaning of waves in dreams, you have your answer. Its spiritual symbolism is relatively straightforward, and it means that you should take control of your emotion and your general life. If you don't, people might abuse you.</p><h3>Peace, tranquillity, fortune and general well-being</h3><p class=align-left>If you dream about drinking water, don't worry; it is a good sign. Since water represents life, rejuvenation, longevity and good health, drinking water is an excellent sign that things will be alright.</p><p class=align-left>However, if you dream about drinking bad water, you should be worried as it might be a reflection of sadness, even if you don't feel it outside.</p><h2>What type of water is in your dream?</h2><p class=align-left>The prophetic meaning of water in your dream is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">associated chiefly with the type of water</a>. You can dream of being in an ocean that means either the unknown or limitless horizon that lies ahead of you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f2b9a6d8f39142ce.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to start a water bottling company in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On the other hand, you might be dreaming about water in a bath or shower, which might indicate you need to attend to personal care.
