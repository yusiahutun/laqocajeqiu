While he prefers to keep his personal life private, his dedication to his craft has made him a prominent figure in the golfing world.</strong></p><p>Geoff contributes as a writer in the golf world. He primarily covers topics such as the state of the game and golf course design. He has written a remarkable collection of eleven books as an accomplished writer.</p><p>His exceptional writing has been featured in renowned publications such as The Los Angeles Times, Sports Illustrated, Golf Magazine, etc.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled-design-70-1.jpg><p>In March 2003, GeoffShackelford.com was launched to delve deeper into the subjects covered in Geoff’s books. This website received much attention in 2004 when Sports Illustrated’s Gary Van Sickle named it one of the Internet’s top ten golf websites.</p><p>Since January 2021, Geoff has held the position of Chief Writing Officer at The Quadrilateral. This year-round newsletter is a comprehensive source covering various aspects of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Grand Slam</a>, Walker Cup, and Ryder Cup.</p><p>The Quadrilateral offers valuable insights and analysis, highlighting Geoff’s expertise as one of golf’s respected voices.</p><p>On March 2023, Geoff hosted the first SoCal Golf Hall of Fame ceremony.</p><h2>Geoff Shackelford Wiki</h2><h3>Age And Family</h3><p>Geoff’s exact age remains unknown. However, based on the information available, it can be presumed that he was born between the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p>Geoff’s mother, Sharon Diane Shackelford, was born on November 27, 1945. The identity of his father has not been disclosed. Sadly, his mother, Diane, passed away on July 10, 2021, after a courageous battle with COVID-19.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Snapinsta.app_260871574_1061864387687645_8270187172902932095_n_1080.jpg><p>Originally from Burbank, California, Diane was born and raised in southern California. Diane was a UCLA graduate. As mentioned in the tribute archive of Diane, Geoff was the only surviving child of his mother.</p><p>Geoff had his maternal grandparents named William and Etta Claunch, while growing up. Sadly, they have now passed away.</p><p>In contrast to Shackelford’s professional life, which is like an open book, his personal life is very private. He has not yet publicly disclosed his relationship or marital status.&nbsp;</p><h3>Education And Career</h3><p>Geoff went to Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, where he excelled as a member of the university’s golf team. In 1994, he graduated with a B.A. in Communication.</p><p>Apart from being a writer and a blogger, Geoff is passionate about studying golf courses, particularly those from the 1920s known as “classic courses.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled-design-71-1.jpg><p>He is involved in design consulting at multiple classic courses. He taught golf course restoration at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Design alongside renowned architect Brian Silva.</p><p>Geoff has shared his expertise on golf course design with various groups, including the American Society of Golf Course Architects, the Alister MacKenzie Society, and the Golf Digest Panelist Summit.</p><h3>Accomplishments</h3><p>In addition to Geoff’s previous accomplishments, he made significant contributions in the field of golf course design. In 2000, he collaborated with architect Gil Hanse from Pennsylvania to co-design the Rustic Canyon Golf Course in Moorpark, California.</p><p>The Golf Digest recognized Rustic Canyon as the Best New Affordable Public Course in America for 2002.</p><p>Geoff’s influence extended beyond design. In 2004 and 2005, he received <a href=# rel=noopener>recognition from The Golfer</a>, which named him one of “modern golf’s ten most influential writers.”</p><p>Another milestone in Geoff’s career was creating his website in 2003. In January 2011, Geoff Shackelford, the website,&nbsp;became a partner website to Golf Digest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCzxKidn2Wjna6kt8SlnaiqlGLEqrfIaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgeoff-shackelford-wiki.html&text=Golf%20Writer%20Family%20And%20Personal%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeoff-shackelford-wiki.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeoff-shackelford-wiki.html&title=Golf%20Writer%20Family%20And%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgeoff-shackelford-wiki.html&title=Golf%20Writer%20Family%20And%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgeoff-shackelford-wiki.html&title=Golf%20Writer%20Family%20And%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeoff-shackelford-wiki.html&description=Golf%20Writer%20Family%20And%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-disable-the-beeper-on-the-schlage-connect-smart-lock.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Disable the Beeper on the Schlage Connect Smart Lock">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dad-35-dies-rare-cancer-just-six-days-marrying-mother-two-kids-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dad, 35, dies from rare cancer just SIX days after marrying mother of his two kids">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
