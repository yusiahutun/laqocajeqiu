Who Is He Dating?</h2><p>The 24-year-old has kept is private life out of the light of social media and paparazzi, but this was not always the case. Back in 2017, Sutherland used to post much about his social life. And as to say so, he didn’t back away from posting about his then-girlfriend Katherine Reis.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Ted Sutherland with girlfriend Katherine Reis on June 2018</strong> (Photo: Ted Sutherland's Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They used to be going well together partly because they were co-actors on the series Rise. However, after two years, in 2019, Reis started posting pictures with her now-boyfriend Jack DiFalco.</p><p>The actor still has a group video of the cast together where these two can be seen in the same frame. But, unfortunately, he seems to have deleted the pictures that he had once kept up of Reis and himself together. On the other hand, Reis can be found sharing lovely times with her now-boyfriend on her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">social media</a>.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>As of recent, we cannot seem to know if he is taken or not. He has managed to keep his private life out of the public eye. So to his fans wondering, he might be single.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe being public about his private life on social media before has led him to have less than ten posts on his Instagram, but either way, his stunning pictures make us stick to our screens and stare for hours.</p><h2>Ted Sutherland Gay? What’s His Sexuality?&nbsp;</h2><p>A common question perhaps, more so after his appearance on the NBC TV&nbsp;show Rise as a gay character named Simon. But as an actor it’s their responsibility to play the part they have put into. And well, if he has made people guess his sexuality, then we think he did his job well.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>However, Sutherland is not gay. He has not talked about the rumors relating to his sexuality. But going by his dating life, we can confirm he is not gay.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Journey So Far!&nbsp;Net Worth?</h2><p>This charming actor dived into the industry when he was about 14-15 years of age. However, he started gaining fans after his appearance on the show rise. This American actor is a prodigy, and it is evident in his movie roles.</p><p>In 2019, he&nbsp;was cast in the role of Elliot Patterson alongside actors such as&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Brendan Fraser</a> in the DC TV Series Doom Patrol. Moreover, he lent his voice for the hit video game franchise, Red Dead Redemption 2.&nbsp;And recently, he can be seen in Netflix's Fear Street Part Two.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>With his appearance on this series, we can confirm that it’s only the beginning of a Hollywood success journey.&nbsp;The American actor has been in the industry for a decade. However, he seems to be making a good mark for himself.</p><p>While his net worth&nbsp;is not officially disclosed with the number of ventures he has done, we feel he is on a quick race to making a million-dollar mark. Nevertheless, Ted has managed to get involved in notable projects in recent years.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Cast Of Doom Patrol :-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Timothy Dalton Now, Movies, Net Worth, Wife</a></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Short Bio: Birthday, Parents, Height</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Ted (height of&nbsp;5 feet &&nbsp;9 inches&nbsp;i.e.1.75&nbsp;meters) celebrates his birthday on 16th March whereas his birthdate is 1997. However, the artist remains very private when it comes to information on his family life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>It is unlikely that his mother or father&nbsp;come from acting background since sources on the internet would have known about it by now. The actor&nbsp;is only 24&nbsp;years with more time to further his career.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-186 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>So, it won't be too long before he shares more details on his personal life.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-653 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZq2dlGLAtsDHnqmlmZ6Zeqi10aWdq6GVo7FuvMCrnKeso2K7sMONoaumpA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fted-sutherland-girlfriend-parents-now-html.html&text=Ted%20Sutherland%20Gay%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fted-sutherland-girlfriend-parents-now-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fted-sutherland-girlfriend-parents-now-html.html&title=Ted%20Sutherland%20Gay%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fted-sutherland-girlfriend-parents-now-html.html&title=Ted%20Sutherland%20Gay%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fted-sutherland-girlfriend-parents-now-html.html&title=Ted%20Sutherland%20Gay%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fted-sutherland-girlfriend-parents-now-html.html&description=Ted%20Sutherland%20Gay%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-best-drake-lyrics-about-self-reflection.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The best Drake lyrics about Self-reflection">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./john-galliano-book-releases-in-time-holidays-plus-10-best-coffee-table-books-give.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Galliano Book Releases in Time for the Holidays (Plus the 10 Best Coffee Table Books to Give)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
