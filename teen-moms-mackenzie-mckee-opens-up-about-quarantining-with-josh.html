"The only things that are hard to read are, 'your husband's a douchebag.' Those are the only things that are annoying to me right now to read."</p><p>Fans saw her marriage hit a rock bottom when Josh confessed to being inappropriate with another woman while on a work trip. McKee made it clear she was through with the relationship even going as far as drawing up divorce papers. However, after Josh promised to change and made a grand gesture on her 25th birthday, she said yes to renewing their wedding vows and start fresh.</p><p>"People couldn't even accept good from Josh. They already decided that they hate him and that was all that was shown. All of the gaps were missed," the MTV star says. "He was hurt and he made a bad decision and that's kind of all that showed in the show."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7aef3861-b25d-5a9e-a827-135a1853e913 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f3f7f7f3-3a88-51b0-bfd9-4d4e0ed4f2b0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3d/5by4/2020/04/28/3dfb8b8244ea5347b7c554b0ae7e2ac4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Amber Portwood's New Belgian Boyfriend Makes Teen Mom OG Debut</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She goes on to give us a bit more context behind the proposal. "He had no clue MTV was in town and if you could ask my mom, he spent hours. He was living out of the house; he wasn't living here. He was sending me gifts every day, trying to get me back. He got saved. And life was good, and we started dating again and just started from the beginning, and he worked so hard and spent so much money on this proposal."</p><p>She knows that it may seem to fans that she "just took it and said 'I forgive you,'" but she tells us that she was "humiliated" because that wasn't the case. "I don't like hearing about us on the internet because I am embarrassed. I feel like I look weak."</p><p>McKee says this wasn't the first problem to arise in her marriage as she admits to having committed adultery herself. "The whole, 'once a cheater, always a cheater' that I'm seeing every day on the internet is bull crap. Because if that's true about him, then it's true about me and I will not accept that."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:50ad4e11-e33b-59e3-83fb-7cb1a0a2744e data-container-ref=toofab:article:f3f7f7f3-3a88-51b0-bfd9-4d4e0ed4f2b0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7a/5by4/2019/12/10/7a26ae90e1ee50ac943ede125c8438ee_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Teen Mom OG Star Mackenzie McKee's Mother Dies of Cancer</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I went and had an affair, and he found out and had to forgive me," she says. "When he asked 'why?' it was because I was not receiving enough attention from [you] during my postpartum depression and another guy was giving me attention."</p><p>When the tables were turned and she asked Josh why he cheated, he pointed to fame and intimacy issues. "Mackenzie, you have not slept with me for 3 years. You don't even let me kiss you. You don't even connect with me. I know I should be here when your mom is sick, but you're asking why. You wouldn't even talk to me or pay attention to me," she remembers. "You know, sometimes you were more about fame than you were humbly about your marriage. You cared about how you looked like on the outside when you weren't in love with me on the inside."</p><p>As for where things currently stand between the two, McKee says that things are not quite back to where they once were. "I am having a hard time loving Josh the way I used to. And I'm kind of just figuring out myself," she says.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:deb84922-b695-57df-a864-db3e811eb9f3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f3f7f7f3-3a88-51b0-bfd9-4d4e0ed4f2b0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e0/5by4/2020/04/27/e00a2624a0e95cb2a72cf8d51479d7c6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Teen Mom OG Star Maci Bookout 'Concerned' About Ryan's Sobriety: 'I Hope I'm Wrong' (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>During a 30-day separation, she worked on herself. "I did therapy those 30 days, I did a fast. I fasted, and I did a 30 day like 'deep dig.'"</p><p>"I know people say 'leave if it's toxic for the kids. It's more unhealthy than to be apart.' It's not a toxic environment, it's just I'm having a hard time loving him. But, you know, it's been good. We're home, we're quarantined. He's been working, he's the moneymaker right now. He's here for us. He holds us together. I'm trying to figure myself out. It's just kind of smoother right now."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3F7j21ma3FfqbKmuoympqarXaKupLfEp7GinV2isKyxxGamqZ2eqHq2vIyamaitpGK%2Btq3RmqWtoZ6eu6h51qKroWWapMCpew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fteen-moms-mackenzie-mckee-opens-up-about-quarantining-with-josh.html&text=Teen%20Moms%20Mackenzie%20McKee%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Quarantining%20with%20Josh%20After%20Cheating%20Scandal&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fteen-moms-mackenzie-mckee-opens-up-about-quarantining-with-josh.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fteen-moms-mackenzie-mckee-opens-up-about-quarantining-with-josh.html&title=Teen%20Moms%20Mackenzie%20McKee%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Quarantining%20with%20Josh%20After%20Cheating%20Scandal" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fteen-moms-mackenzie-mckee-opens-up-about-quarantining-with-josh.html&title=Teen%20Moms%20Mackenzie%20McKee%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Quarantining%20with%20Josh%20After%20Cheating%20Scandal" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fteen-moms-mackenzie-mckee-opens-up-about-quarantining-with-josh.html&title=Teen%20Moms%20Mackenzie%20McKee%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Quarantining%20with%20Josh%20After%20Cheating%20Scandal" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fteen-moms-mackenzie-mckee-opens-up-about-quarantining-with-josh.html&description=Teen%20Moms%20Mackenzie%20McKee%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Quarantining%20with%20Josh%20After%20Cheating%20Scandal" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ap-aryna-sabalenka-edges-madison-keys-in-us-open-semifinals-will-play-coco-gauff-on-saturday.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aryna Sabalenka edges Madison Keys in US Open semifinals, will play Coco Gauff on Saturday">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./taylor-swift-and-boyfriend-travis-kelce-spend-loved-up-celebrations-with-family-after-teasing-engagement-and-baby-rumors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Swift and boyfriend Travis Kelce spend loved up celebrations with family after teasing engage">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
