"Yeah, that's going to happen; it's part of life," she told the person on the other line. "I'm not too worried about it. Yeah, don't stress out."</p><p>But the backlash clearly affected her.

"Which means that the only interactions I'd ever had were with family members or other adults."</p><p>That had a long-lasting affect on her, with Paris admitting she "didn't have social skills" by the time she was 12.</p><p>"I had to force myself to learn so fast," she explained. "For the past six years, I've been learning how to communicate. And I think I've gotten pretty good at it."</p><p>"Once I got introduced into the real world, I was shocked.
