However, during one of their visits on the father-son road trips, David Letterman fell over and was knocked out, being told he had a concussion from the scary incident.

Instead, they went their separate ways as they scoped the institution out.</p><p>The 76-year-old found some shops, picked up some Warby Parker glasses and bought himself a hot coffee in Starbucks. When he was walking back to the car to meet his son, he fell on flat ground, but because his hands were full with his shopping, his face broke the fall.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a> everything went ‘white’ and he was knocked out.</p><p>“I’m walking purposefully because I know I’m late, I don’t want Harry to wonder ‘where the hell dad is?’.</p><p>“Out of nowhere, I fall, full-force, and hit my face on the cement sidewalk.”</p><p>He added: “I saw this white flash in my head and that was it, I’m out cold. I don’t know how long I was out, but I finally come to and the first thought I have is ‘Harry is gonna be so p****d off'”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-david-letterman-was-taken-to-hospital-after-the-concussion>David Letterman was taken to hospital after the concussion</h2><p>The Late Show host says a group of people surrounded him, checking if he was alright.</p><p>He explains there was a lot of blood because he hit his head, so they called emergency responders. Fire crews were first on the scene, and after they checked on him, they called an ambulance.</p><p>They insisted on taking him to hospital, but he tells paramedics his son needs to know where he is. So the vehicle ends up riding around the campus asking for ‘Harry’, until they find him.</p><p>When they arrive at Rhode Island hospital, he tells Harry not to tell his mother, or she’d worry about his <a href=#>health</a>.</p><p>He says: “It’s crowded, they get us, and they take care of us, and they clean me up.</p><p>“They scanned my brain and gave me an x-ray, this other guy flossed my teeth,” he quipped.</p><p>He was thankful that everything was fine, but he needed 180 stitches above his eye.</p><p>But the interesting part was that he said his brain was fine after the accident – except he couldn’t remember <a href=#>Eric Clapton</a>‘s name for months on end. Thankfully, that was the only side effect.</p><p>However, as soon as they return home, Harry spilled the beans about David’s concussion to Letterman’s wife.
