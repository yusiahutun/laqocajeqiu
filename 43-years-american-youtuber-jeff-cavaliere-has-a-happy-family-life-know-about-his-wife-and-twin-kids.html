Meet his wife and children here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>[updated]</strong></p><h2><strong>What is Jeff Cavaliere Up To Now? Is He Still Married?</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jeff Cavaliere</strong></a>, an American fitness guru is still married to his long-term girlfriend turned wife. Their relationship has grown deeper and stronger than they had before. They have been united as life partners for over eleven years now.</p><p>The athlete took a cute picture hugged by his spouse on the very occasion of Valentine's Day at the gym. On February 15, 2020, Cavaliere wore a similar outfit to Miss. Cavaliere.</p><p>He wrote "Happy Valentine's Day to you and yours. Remember guys, even if you screwed up and forgot to get a gift, there's always thus...face pulls are forever.</p><p>The ATHLEAN_X founder is living a blissful life with his partner and their twin sons, Jason and Xavier. Needless to say, the New York Mets coach is a family man who prefers to spend a good time with his kids and spouse in the meantime rather than getting busy with his work.</p><h2>Jeff Cavaliere: Living A Blissful Married Life With His Wife</h2><p>There's not much known about <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jeff Cavaliere</strong></a>'s family life but it's pretty clear that he's a married man.</p><p>Some reliable sources reported that he tied the knot with his soulmate in 2008 after dating for a couple of years. It seems like they are high school sweethearts.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/10/jeff-caval.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jeff Cavaliere has maintained his married life ultra-private with his wife. Source: Gazette Review</p><p>The physiotherapist has managed to keep his wife away from the public. He mentioned his spouse in one of his Instagram posts back in November 2017 wearing a Halloween costume.</p><p>Though she barely appears on Cavaliere's posts, their twin sons frequently appear with their father.</p><p><strong>You May Like</strong>:<strong><a href=# rel=noopener> Fitness Model Cori Nadine, is she Dating someone already Married? Know her Current Relationship Status</a></strong></p><p>The proud and loving father celebrated 'Father's Day' in June 2018 posting an image with the adorable kids. He captioned,</p><p>"Happy Fathers Day" doesn't always mean happy sons! After all, if mom's taking the picture she can't be holding them (their favorite place to be!). That's ok. I hear the balance of parental power shifts as they get older. I mean, let's face it, when it comes time to learn proper application of muscle markers and the finer points of spider curls...they'll know where their bread is buttered."</p><p>" In all seriousness, I've worn many hats in my life but NONE have been more rewarding than being a dad to these two little men. I pray every day to be someone they look up to and emulate as an example of rock-solid principles."</p><p>Being a father of two, he remembered how much his father struggled for him during his childhood days. He mentioned that he's determined to do the same for them.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>As there are no rumors about Cavaliere getting divorced or any disturbance in his married life, we are sure that the couple is still so strong and dedicated to their relationship.</p><p>Cavaliere celebrated <a href=# rel=noopener>Valentine's Day</a> with his gorgeous wife and posted an image via Instagram post.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2019/03/08/jeff-cavaliere-with-his-lovely-wife-celebrating-valentine-s-day--1552037058.gif width=450 height=503 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><strong><span class=imageCaption>Jeff Cavaliere with his lovely wife celebrating Valentine's Day.&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p>The above image is captioned,</p><p>"The wife and I haven't slept in weeks.
