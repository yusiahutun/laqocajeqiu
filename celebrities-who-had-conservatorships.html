The legal agreement was put in place after Amanda faced a series of personal difficulties, including several driving and drug-related arrests and some erratic behavior that culminated in a psychiatric hold. Amanda entered treatment, where she was diagnosed as bipolar and manic depressive, and Lynn was placed in charge of her estate which was <a href=#>reportedly</a> worth over $5 million at the time.</p><p>In the years following, Amanda enrolled in college and didn’t speak much about her personal life as she took a step back from the spotlight. Then in 2020, Amanda decided to speak out about her conservatorship on Instagram, explaining she wasn’t happy with the terms and wished to speak with a judge about spending less money on her treatment.</p><p>"I have been going to a treatment center that charges $5,200 a month. There's no reason why I shouldn't go to a therapist who takes my insurance for $5,000 less a month. This is why I've asked to see the judge next week regarding this conservatorship issue...I'm sorry that this is what I'm dealing with and I'm sorry that I put my problems onto the Internet, but this is what life has come to," Amanda <a href=#>said</a> in a video.

Brian Wilson</strong></p><p>The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson was placed under a conservatorship in the 1990s after years of treatment from a questionable psychologist. Dr. Eugene Landy had been hired by Brian’s wife in 1975 in order to help the musician deal with his drug abuse and other concerning behaviors. Unfortunately, he was misdiagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and overmedicated. Over time, Dr. Landy's unorthodox round the clock treatment saw him taking more and more control over Brian's life, from the food he ate to the music he wrote.</p><p>Years later, Brian's new girlfriend saw that there was something terribly wrong with the situation surrounding Dr. Landy, who had become Brian’s legal guardian, and began to fight for the musician's freedom. The Wilson family filed a lawsuit and asked the court to place Brian under a conservatorship. By 1992, Dr. Landy was banned from contacting Brian and the musician's affairs were placed under a conservatorship's control.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e1f7d64b-b55b-46a4-a91a-f6cd9ab8480f data-container-ref=toofab:article:a0b5136b-b9e6-460a-9044-d87998e9b972 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9f/5by4/2021/07/01/9fd6a8edbca84530a4a0ffbc34b19eca_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Iggy Azalea Supports Britney Spears' Claims About Dad Jamie: 'She Is Not Exaggerating or Lying'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Joni Mitchell</strong></a></p><p>After Joni Mitchell suffered an aneurysm that left her unable to speak in 2015, she was placed under a temporary conservatorship controlled by her friend Leslie Morris.
