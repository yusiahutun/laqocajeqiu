She lived raised in her father’s Graceland home until she was four years old when her parents divorced.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lisa-marie-presley-childhood-1024x1024.jpg><p>Presley relocated to Los Angeles, California, with her mother. Even though her parents were divorced, she continued to see both of them, dividing her time between Los Angeles and Memphis.</p><p>When she was nine years old, Presley’s father died of an apparent heart failure related to prescription drug misuse.</p><h2>Lisa Marie Presley’s Net Worth and Income</h2><p><strong>The American songwriter, actress, and singer Lisa Marie Presley’s net worth is a staggering $-16 million as of 2023.</strong></p><p>Following her father Elvis Presley’s death from an overdose, Lisa became the only heir to his fortune. She was, however, too young to claim her half of the inheritance at the time.</p><p>Lisa was able to obtain the trust her father had left her when she turned 25. Lisa Marie Presley’s estimated net worth is -$16 million, putting her in a near-bankruptcy situation.</p><p>Her inheritance is worth $14000 (cash). Her mother has a net worth of $50 million, which is surprising.</p><h3>Inheritance</h3><p>When Lisa’s father died, she was nine years old. Elvis Presley was unconcerned about money, and he was known for his extravagant spending during his lifetime.</p><p>However, Elvis Presley’s manager, Colonel Tom Parker, was robbing him utterly, stealing half of his revenues. Elvis Presley’s estate was valued at $5 million at the time of his death, which is the equivalent of $14 million in today’s money.</p><p>His wife Priscilla (also Lisa’s mother) served as the sole executor of his estate, intended to be bequeathed to Lisa. Lisa Marie, on the other hand, was just nine years old at the time.</p><p>After seeing that Lisa’s bequest had been reduced to just $1 million after all expenses and fees, Priscilla began rebuilding the estate and coping with its poor predicament.</p><p>She took the bold decision of converting Graceland (Elvis’ mansion) into a museum, and she paid off all debtors and unpaid expenditures just four days after it opened.</p><p>Lisa inherited her father’s inheritance when she was 25 years old, and it was worth $100 million (equal to $295 million in today’s money).</p><p>Rather than inheriting the money outright, she established a revocable living trust and named Barry Seigel to handle the funds.</p><p>Seigel decided to sell 85 percent of EPE (Elvis Presley Enterprises), the company that handled all of Elvis’ image rights and royalties, in February 2005.</p><h4>Additional</h4><p>Despite EPE being worth $100 million, Lisa Marie only received $40 million after taxes from Seigel’s deal. However, the deal includes $25 million worth of stock in American Idol’s future holding company, so it wasn’t all awful.</p><p>Unfortunately, between 2005 and 2015, the money completely dried up. Part of this was due to Lisa’s extravagant spending habits, but it was also likely due to financial mismanagement by Seigel and other financial managers.</p><p>After all, was said and done, Lisa Marie had only $14,000 left in the trust she had established. She was also said to owe over $500,000 in credit card debt.</p><h3>Financial Problem</h3><p>Lisa Marie Presley had fired Barry Siegel by 2015. She sued her former business manager for allegedly squandering $100 million of her riches and leaving her bankrupt two years later.</p><p>She said that the EPE deal was a bad idea and that he failed to tell her the truth about the Presley estate’s status.</p><p>Barry Siegel claimed that Lisa Marie’s extravagant spending habits caused the estate’s large losses in his defense.</p><p>He also claimed to have met with her regularly for business meetings, during which he explained the issue and warned her to keep her expenditures under control.</p><p>Seigel also claimed that Lisa’s extravagant spending habits had put her estate $20 million in debt by 2003, which he later rectified.</p><p>Lisa Marie reacted by stating that she was unaware of the state of her estate and that if Seigel had told her the truth, she would have cut her expenditures and immediately decreased his $700,000 pay.</p><p>She said that if she had merely been handed the estate’s revenue, she could have lived happily on $1.5 to $2.5 million per year. Due to Covid-19, the continuing legal dispute was put on pause in 2020.</p><p>Lisa Marie has $16 million in debt, according to court filings from her divorce proceedings with Michael Lockwood in 2018. Unpaid taxes from 2012 to 2015 account for $10 million of the debt.</p><p>Credit card bills and unpaid attorney fees make up the rest of the debt. After her ex sought $450,000 to settle his legal bills, Lisa filed the paperwork.</p><h3>Lisa Marie Presley’s Net Worth in Different Currencies</h3><p>Let’s take a look at Lisa Marie Presely’s Net Worth in several currencies, including BitCoin, the cryptocurrency.</p><table class=mytable width=696><tbody><tr><td>Currency</td><td>Net Worth</td></tr><tr><td>Euro</td><td>€&nbsp;<span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":34100452}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDEUR")*R[-1]C[-1]'>34,100,452</span></td></tr><tr><td>Pound Sterling</td><td>£&nbsp;<span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":29166000}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDGBP")*R[-2]C[-1]'>29,166,000</span></td></tr><tr><td>Australian Dollar</td><td>A$&nbsp;<span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":55540120}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDAUD")*R[-3]C[-1]'>55,540,120</span></td></tr><tr><td>Canadian Dollar</td><td>C$&nbsp;<span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":50729999.99999999}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDCAD")*R[-4]C[-1]'>50,730,000</span></td></tr><tr><td>Indian Rupee</td><td>₹&nbsp;<span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":1637251000000}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDINR")*R[-5]C[-1]'>2,965,204,000</span></td></tr><tr><td>BitCoin</td><td>฿ 806</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Lisa Marie Presley: House, Cars, Aircraft Lisa Marie</h2><h3>House</h3><h4>English Retreat</h4><p>The £4,500,000 house had been on the market since 2017.

The Hidden Hills neighborhood is well-known for attracting celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Ozzy Osbourne, and Sharon Osbourne.</p><p>A one-bedroom guest house with a sound booth is included with the property.

Only the Range Rover SVAutobiography LWB, which starts at over $146,000, is less expensive.</p><h4>1973 Porsche 911 Carrera rs</h4><p>When it comes to Porsche 911s, the 1973 Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7 is commonly regarded as the holy grail. At the time, 500 devices were produced, each costing over USD 10,000, and the firm was unsure if they would be able to sell them all.</p><p>On the other hand, the vehicle sold out in less than a week after its debut at the Paris Motor Show. During the production period, Porsche built 1,590 of these cars.</p><h4>Chevrolet Tahoe</h4><p>The Chevy Tahoe is an excellent large SUV. Because of its outstanding combination of luggage and passenger space, safety and reliability ratings, positive reviews from automotive journalists, and available family-friendly features, we designated it a finalist for our 2021 Best Large SUV for Families.</p><p>Despite its size, it’s rather easy to maneuver, and it comes with three capable engine options, including two powerful V8s and a fuel-efficient turbodiesel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lisa-marie-presley-car-Chevrolet-Tahoe-1024x768.jpg><p>In addition, the Chevy features a lot of passenger and freight room. Furthermore, this SUV features a well-equipped infotainment system as well as a class-leading projected dependability rating.</p><h3>Aircraft Lisa Marie</h3><p>Her father named one of his private planes, a converted Convair 880 jet (original passenger capacity: 100), after her in November 1975. He spent over a million dollars restoring it to serve as his primary mode of transportation while on tour.</p><p>At Graceland, the Lisa Marie and another of his planes, Hound Dog II, are on display. Both planes were rumored to be for sale in January 2015. They’re no longer flyable, but their owner was hoping to sell them for a total of $10 million.</p><p>The buyer would have the option of purchasing acreage adjacent to Graceland and exhibiting them separately. The Elvis Presley estate eventually acquired them back, and they are still on display.</p><h2>Lisa Marie Presley: Lifestyle and Vacation</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Lisa has gone through a lot of weight gain and loss in the last few years. However, the lovely lady can now be seen in her late forties in the best shape of her life.</p><p>Her father’s side of the family has a history of short life spans, which has always left the singer awestruck and perplexed about food consumption. Aside from that, Lisa faced major issues in maintaining her form due to a family history of obesity and diabetes.</p><p>However, now that she understands the importance of eating well and exercising regularly, Lisa has been rigorously adhering to these healthy habits, which have surely paid off handsomely for the sensational vocalist.</p><p>It makes her feel fantastic when she notices herself getting fit in her slender and favorite clothes, and the gorgeous feeling motivates her to keep going with her workout routine.</p><h4>Diet Plan</h4><p>The brunette is finally on board with a nutritious diet after being tempted to lose weight quickly in the past by succumbing to crash or fad diet plans. She was well aware that denying her body of food is not a gratifying technique to get a slim physique.</p><p>The gorgeous vocalist eats healthful foods that are a perfect combination of low-carb and organic foods. In her diet, she incorporates a variety of healthful and nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables, chicken, nuts, fish, fruits, almonds, fresh juices, milk, and so on.</p><p>Lisa tries to avoid foods that are harmful to her health, such as high-carbohydrate foods, gluten-containing foods, and dairy products.</p><p>These foods create inflammation in your gut and a surge in your blood sugar level since they don’t get along with your metabolism.</p><p>They not only create bodily problems, but they also make you vulnerable to depression and other mental illnesses if you consume them frequently.</p><p>She not only avoids certain items, but she carefully watches her portions. She doesn’t feel forced to finish the entire dish that has been placed in front of her.</p><p>Lisa consumes her foods slowly because she has learned the skill of keeping her hunger at bay by ingesting smaller portion sizes of foods. This makes her feel fuller sooner.</p><p>High-carbohydrate foods, such as white rice, white pasta, and bread cause her mind to wake up. Because our metabolism slows down at night, she avoids consuming these meals at that time of day.</p><h4>Work Out Routine</h4><p>The joyful singer is a firm believer in sticking to a strict workout schedule. Instead of doing strenuous workouts, Lisa opts for mild workouts like thirty minutes of brisk walking.</p><p>Walking is an excellent way to begin and prolong a cardio workout.
