According to his LinkedIn profile, he is now a salesperson for Prudential Insurance. Eason’s initial venture into the business world involved creating his landscaping company during high school.</p><p>As a youngster, he had assisted his uncle’s company with some yard work, and this experience prompted him to establish Eason’s Scapes & Services at the age of 16.

However, their attraction increased significantly when they finally met in person during the finale. The couple had separated just six months before Francesca Farago, a contestant on “Too Hot to Handle” season 1, intentionally set them up on a “blind date” in the Netflix show “Perfect Match.”</p><p>During the date, it became clear that they still had a genuine love for each other, as both Chloe and Mitchell confirmed, also from “Too Hot to Handle.” As a result, Francesca sadly decided to end things with Shayne Jensen, a contestant from “Love is Blind” season 2, whom she also liked, to pursue things with her ex.</p><p>The question is whether the ex-partners (Chloe and Mitchell) are still in a relationship or have any romantic involvement. The clear response is NO – despite their amicable interactions on social media, Chloe and Mitchell are no longer romantically involved.</p><h3>Mitchell Eason Net Worth</h3><p>Mitchell Eason, who showcased his mansion on a YouTube tour, is making millions through his success in various fields, including business, insurance, real estate, and working in TV reality shows.</p><span class=simplesocialtxt>Facebook</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Twitter</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Reddit</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>WhatsApp</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Pinterest</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZa5tbTYrKeyZpOkunC5yK2aoZ2coXqmrdKopWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmitchell-eason.html&text=Mitchell%20Eason%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmitchell-eason.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmitchell-eason.html&title=Mitchell%20Eason%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmitchell-eason.html&title=Mitchell%20Eason%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmitchell-eason.html&title=Mitchell%20Eason%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmitchell-eason.html&description=Mitchell%20Eason%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./square-consulting-rohan-bhatt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rohan Bhatt | SQuare Consulting">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lara-spencer-leaves-fans-in-awe-time-away-from-gma-with-look-alike-daughter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lara Spencer leaves fans in awe with glimpse of time away from GMA with look-alike daughter">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
