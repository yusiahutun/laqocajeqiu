With digital music, there are many interesting career options that you can explore. A career in music isn't just limited to the physical stage, it's now expanded along with the digital age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, there are endless options within the online space, and you can make these spaces work for you. Here are some careers you can pursue!</p><h2 id=build-a-music-blog>1. Build a Music Blog</h2><p>Building a blog may sound like a tedious task, but with the right tools, you can create a music blog that will generate not just readers' attention and interest in your musical expertise, but a genuine following of passionate learners. Firstly, choose a platform you find comfortable to use, such as WordPress, and start building your template.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Create a page detailing who you are, what music interests you, what you play, what you compose, or just general information about your blog. Will you be reviewing music products, such as music-making programs or different brands of electric drum kits? Will you have a primary focus on MIDI, such as how to incorporate synthesizers into your music experience?</p><p>Moreover, affiliate marketing is a good way to make money and create general music content. You gain a small percentage every time somebody clicks on an advertisement through your blog.</p><h2 id=become-a-remote-teacher>2. Become a Remote Teacher</h2><p>Ever thought about teaching musical theory to others online? You can become a teacher online in many ways with the digital media of today, and there is a lot of support available. Sign up with an organization such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tutor.com</a> that can help you find students in need of learning assistance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tutor.com is a great example of remote teaching as it allows college students, teachers, and professionals of all sorts to offer their tutoring services to children of all ages! If you're aiming to go the freelance route however, consider putting together a YouTube channel with your own lessons and content.</p><p>Choose an instrument to focus on, plan your content throughout the week, market yourself through social media, and you'll be on your way to making a difference.</p><h2 id=delve-into-music-journalism>3. Delve Into Music Journalism</h2><p>Have you always had a passion for telling stories, particularly about your favorite albums or musicians? Music journalism is still going strong, and you can make a career as a music journalist by pitching to digital magazines such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether it's an album review of your favorite band, a news story on Adela, or an opinion piece about a music festival, all of this content is highly valued by music publications. If you really want to get noticed by an editor-in-chief, have a look at <a href=#>how to cold pitch your way to career success</a>.</p><h2 id=create-an-online-course>4. Create an Online Course</h2><p>How good are you at your designated instrument? Can you play a song on the piano with your eyes closed, or are you good at recording your own songs? If so, you can consider creating an online course and helping others reach your level. Learning how to play any instrument takes a lot of time and patience for both student and teacher, so this career path can be extremely rewarding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Udemy or SkillShare are excellent options for this, as they offer flexibility to create the course you're looking for. Segment your course into multiple easy-to-understand videos such as learning chords and scales, how to read basic sheet music, or the foundations of music theory, and gradually increase the difficulty of this as your course moves forward. Your students will thank you!</p><h2 id=become-an-audio-editor>5. Become an Audio Editor</h2><p>Do you have a skill for transposing music, and think you would excel as an audio editor? This field has a broad scope as you could be editing audio for film, TV, businesses of all sizes, marketing and advertising agencies, and even the gaming industry. Imagine being able to be the creator behind the new soundtrack of a video game or app, or the star behind the flashy sound effects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An audio editor involves creative freedom and imagination, flexibility in the type of jobs you can apply for, and the chance to work for a range of interesting individuals. Looking to get started in this field? If you have an Android device and want to sharpen your audio-editing skill set, here are <a href=#>the best audio editing apps for Android</a>!</p><h2 id=compose-your-own-music>6. Compose Your Own Music</h2><p>Have you always experimented with software such as Audacity or Adobe Audition, and have come to realize that it's more than a hobby? Whether you've wanted your own YouTube channel consisting of relaxing music that people constantly add to their playlists, or just enjoy piecing together instrumentals for fun, this is a great career option in the digital music field.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're recording live, you'll need to invest in high-quality equipment such as microphones, headphones or monitors, an XLR mic cable, a mic stand, a pop filter, a reliable Digital Audio Workstation for mastering your tracks, and a computer fast enough to make it happen. An Audio Interface is also very important, as it plugs your microphone into your PC through USB, Firewire, or Thunderbolt.</p><p>For digital music, a MIDI controller, synthesizer, or launchpad is a great way to create sound on virtual software, especially if you can't afford to pay top dollar for a piano. Notation software is also handy for putting your composed track onto sheet music. Want to learn more about recreating acoustic instruments through a MIDI device? Here is <a href=#>how to make MIDI piano sound realistic in your DAW</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=compose-a-career-in-digital-music>Compose a Career in Digital Music</h2><p>If you enjoy music, it probably won't be tough for you to make it a career path in the future. With several options available to you, you'll be on your way to selling your music.</p><p>So don't doubt yourself and your musical abilities, build an online portfolio on SoundCloud and bring your digital music goals forward.
