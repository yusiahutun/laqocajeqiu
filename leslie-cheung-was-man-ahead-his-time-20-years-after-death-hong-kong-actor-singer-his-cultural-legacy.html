He released more than 40 music albums and appeared in 56 films.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/29/f5565550-07ce-4970-b1cb-587411e9b00d_9154d5c3.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He helped push Cantopop to new heights in the 1980s, scoring hit after hit. Some of his releases were Chinese adaptations of Japanese pop tunes, which was the trend at the time, and some were original compositions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the 1990s, Cheung received widespread acclaim for his portrayals of either womanising or queer characters on screen. This was during a time when Hong Kong was still relatively conservative towards non-heteronormative identities.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Leslie Cheung celebrated in Hong Kong: rare items to be exhibited for 1st time</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite being widely recognised now as a queer fashion icon, his flamboyant and controversial looks on stage were not always appreciated when he performed.</p>“I vividly remember going to a concert and seeing [Cheung] perform as the supporting act. He threw his hat to the audience, a moment after which the hat was thrown back onto the stage,” recalls Stanley Kwan Kam-pang, director of the critically acclaimed 1988 film <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Rouge</span></a>, starring Cheung and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Anita Mui Yim-fong – another home- grown star</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He was quite sad about the incident when we discussed it afterwards; but at the same time, it became his motivation to work even harder to gain respect in show business.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/29/84bc73de-e0a4-4be4-95ba-c7d4d28474e2_148d6b76.jpg>Perhaps it was this hardship that led him to recognise the importance of support. Throughout his career, Cheung was an avid philanthropist to several charities for children, the elderly and victims of a natural disaster, the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Taiwanese earthquake of 1999</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He donated all the profits from his 1989 platinum-selling album Salute to the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts. Following his death, his family set up the Leslie Cheung Memorial Scholarship at the institution to help encourage outstanding students and support those from lower-income backgrounds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Asked about Cheung’s abiding legacy, Kwan says: “With the remastered version of Rouge coming out recently and re-watching the film on the silver screen, it felt like he and Anita Mui had never left us; as if just a week ago we shot Mui, and two weeks ago we shot Cheung.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The communication, chemistry and collaboration between the two were exquisite, which I found enjoyable and inspiring.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/29/f345b246-4ca9-468f-99a3-f6937530b7c4_9a0569a8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cheung took a break from his singing career between 1989 and 1995, but that did not mean he stayed away from music. For the gender-bending 1994 film He’s a Woman, She’s a Man, he worked on “Chase”, a track that won him best original song at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My biggest impression of Cheung and our interaction is when we did the score for He’s a Woman, She’s a Man,” recalls Chiu Tsang-hei, a music producer who worked on the film.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“At that time, he had already quit his career as a singer; but, in my opinion, this was the film that inspired him to sing again – or one of the reasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/29/89e81c85-96de-4775-9dfb-1a194f380262_e011ebd3.jpg>“Cheung’s involvement in the film was much more than that of just an actor. For a scene where he and another character were writing a song, he came into our recording studio along with the director [<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Peter Chan Ho-sun</span></a>], as they tried to envision how the scene was going to be shot.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was on the piano while he was recording the sound on the spot, very similar to how the scene played out. Watching it all happen was exhilarating, and the outcome was especially magical to me,” Chiu says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong’s Tony Leung to receive lifetime achievement award at Venice Film Festival</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among the many artworks on show at Tai Kwun’s “Myth Makers – Spectrosynthesis III” exhibition, which ends on April 10, is Oscar Chan Yik-long’s You just suck my soul without any hesitation (2022), a painting inspired by a scene in the film in which Cheung kisses Leung from behind.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People praised Leung a lot for acting as a gay character in the film, but I think Cheung was just as good. In my opinion, it was the public’s limited view on [heteronormative] stereotypes which led to more praise for Leung rather than Cheung.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I remember watching one of Cheung’s performances in the late ’90s as a child and thinking that [his cross-dressing] was so cool. It doesn’t matter what my own sexual orientation is, but his long hair and androgynous looks of sexual fluidity were universally inspiring,” explains the artist who, similarly, sports straight black hair that is lusciously long.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/29/9f4fb275-6f4d-4b9f-8397-eeb5c5aec17f_d3a013a9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2000 and 2001, Cheung collaborated with French haute couture designer Jean Paul Gaultier on costumes for his Passion Tour concerts in Hong Kong and overseas that drew attention to the singer’s androgyny. It was a bold stance to publicise his nonconforming gender identity alongside his bisexuality.</p>“Leslie Cheung was a man ahead of his time – his declaration of his love for a man was nothing short of extraordinary. Even in these days where we’re supposed to have a greater level of acceptance of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">LGBT+ people</span></a>, it takes courage for celebrities to come out,” says Jerome Yau, the vice-chair and chief executive of Pink Alliance, Hong Kong’s leading non-profit LGBTQ organisation.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As such, Leslie was not only a trailblazer but also a driving force in making Hong Kong’s LGBT+ community more visible at that time. And the enduring legacy is that one should be proud of who they are, irrespective of sexual orientation and gender identity.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/29/7110c996-6c59-4331-a0f0-a2d8c80200b3_3edc1ef9.jpg>When Cantopop and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hong Kong cinema</span></a> became a dominant cultural force in the region – in mainland China as well as north and Southeast Asia – Cheung was one of the city’s most prominent faces, someone who fearlessly and glamorously pushed gender boundaries and embodied gender fluidity.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cheung would have been 67 this year. His suicide has, over the past two decades, helped raise public awareness of the importance of mental health.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Professor Paul Yip Siu-fai, director of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, the local suicide rate in 2003 was around 18.6 deaths per 100,000 people, the highest recorded to date.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/29/851606cd-e684-4a6b-af2e-80edc2e29abe_cf2cfb07.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In the past 20 years, our society’s view of mental illness has improved. The news reporting of Cheung’s death was rather sensationalised, but nowadays, the media has an improved view of mental illness and suicide attempts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s not as taboo as before, but a stigma remains. There is still not enough support for people with depression,” Yip says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is where the government needs to come in and take initiative to address the issue at hand. Oftentimes government officials claim they will do something to improve [the city’s mental health], but lack follow-up. We need more services to help those struggling.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/29/9cf18551-82c5-41fe-9594-8a2092de2557_6817c2e6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During a 1985 telecast of the Jade Solid Gold Best 10 Awards Presentation, Cantopop singer Ken Choi Fung-wah took a jab at Cheung, likening his meteoric rise to “a moment of brilliance” that “won’t last forever”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">History has, to date, proved otherwise.</p>If you have suicidal thoughts, or you know someone who is, help is available.
