He is of German, Scottish and English descent.</p><p>During his high school years, Mark was a football player, a game he played until his university days. After high school, he attended the University of Vermont, where he is a member of the men’s soccer team. It was at college that Mark began performing stand-up comedy, using his stage name “Boone”, which he has retained to this day.
