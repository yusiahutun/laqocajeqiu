Barry Williams is best known for his part as Greg Brady, the oldest of the Brady sons, in the ABC television series “The Brady Bunch” (1969–1974).</span></h3><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Career>Early Life and Career</span></h2><p>Barry Williams was born Barry William Blenkhorn on <strong>September 30, 1954</strong>, in Santa Monica, California, U.S. He is currently<strong> 68 years old</strong>. He was born to his father Frank Millar Blenkhorn and his mother Doris May Moore. Barry was raised in &nbsp;Pacific Palisades, California along with his siblings Craig Blenkhorn and Scott Blenkhorn. He holds American nationality and is of mixed ethnic background (English-Scottish-German). According to his date of birth, he was born under the zodiac sign Libra.</p><p>In 1967, Williams made his television debut in a “Christmas” episode of Dragnet 1967 after deciding as a young child that he wanted to be an actor. Greg Brady, the oldest son on The Brady Bunch from the 1970s, was Williams’ most well-known character. Before being cast as Greg Brady on The Brady Bunch in 1969, Williams continued to be cast in supporting roles on other TV shows, such as Adam-12, The Invaders, That Girl, Mission: Impossible, The Mod Squad, Here Come the Brides, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., and Bartleby, the Scrivener.</p><h2><span id=Later_Career>Later Career</span></h2><p>Williams continued to play cameo roles on television after The Brady Bunch was canceled in 1974. He also started working in musical theater, touring with shows like Grease, The Sound of Music, Pippin, and West Side Story. Williams made a Broadway debut in 1988 in the musical Romance/Romance alongside Alison Fraser, who was nominated for a Tony Award. Scott Bakula left the production, and Williams assumed the lead male role of “Alfred/Sam”. Williams was able to profit from playing Greg Brady years later. He was cast in a role that was different from the Brady image despite a string of TV and film roles that emphasized his well-known teen role.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-365229 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Barry-Williams-TODAY.jpg alt="Barry Williams" width=650 height=438 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-365229 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Barry Williams with the cast members of&nbsp; the TV series, The Brady Bunch<br>Source: TODAY</p><p>Furthermore, he was chosen to play the English con artist Hannibal on the popular General Hospital in 1984, who plotted with Holly Sutton Scorpio (Emma Samms). A Very Brady Christmas, a 1988 holiday film, is one of the Brady Bunch TV movie reunions in which Williams has acted. Williams received the Former Child Star “Lifetime Achievement” Award from the Young Artist Foundation in 1989 for his portrayal of Greg Brady. Growing Up Brady: I Was A Teenager Greg, his 1992 autobiography co-written with Chris Kreski, was a New York Times best-seller and was made into a TV movie in 2000 with Adam Brody playing Williams.</p><h4>More…</h4><p>Moreover, he relocates to Branson, Missouri, in 2019, and performs on tour with Barry Williams and the Travelers. Additionally, he appeared alongside the other Brady Bunch kids in the 2019 HGTV series A Very Brady Renovation. Alongside his Brady Bunch co-stars Christopher Knight, Mike Lookinland, Susan Olsen, and Robbie Rist, Williams starred in the Lifetime holiday film Blending Christmas in 2021. Williams, Knight, and Lookinland participated as “Mummies” in season eight of The Masked Singer in 2022. On “TV Theme Night,” along with Daymond John in the role of “Fortune Teller,” they were eliminated.</p><h2><span id=Actors8217_Equity_Association_dispute><span id="Actors'_Equity_Association_dispute" class=mw-headline>Actors’ Equity Association dispute</span></span></h2><p>Williams was penalized $52,000 by the Actors’ Equity Association, the organization that represents stage actors, in January 2001 for playing Captain Von Trapp in a non-union performance of The Sound of Music. Variety claims that the movie was picketed in several cities. Williams retaliated by filing a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, claiming that the fine was invalid because he had left the union in September 2000, before the start of the tour, and that this made the fine illegal.</p><p>Williams, who joined the union in 1974, was allegedly still a member when he started contract talks for the position, according to Equity. Following his unionization of a non-Equity production of A Christmas Carol in late 2004, Williams was re-instated by Actor’s Equity as a member in good standing in 2005.</p><h2><span id=Barry_Williams_8211_Net_Worth_2023>Barry Williams – Net Worth 2023</span></h2><p>This veteran successful American actor has earned a hefty amount of money throughout his career.
