Naviyd was born in Atlanta, Georgia, weighing 5 pounds 13 ounces on December 10, 2008. The name “Naviyd” is derived from the Persian word “Naveed,” which means good news.</p><p>Similarly, his middle name, “Ely,” is an alternative form of the Hebrew name “Lazarus,” which signifies Yahweh is God, or God is my helper.&nbsp;Like most celebrity kids, not so much is known about Naviyd. However, we know enough to give you a clear picture of his life.</p><p>Here’s everything we know about Naviyd and his parent’s relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9245a03ec763311a03012ab041660d3e-fotor-20230708141335.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Naviyd_Ely_Raymond_at_the_AMIRI_Autumn-Winter_2022_Runway></span>Was Naviyd Ely Raymond at the AMIRI Autumn-Winter 2022 Runway?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fans are amazed at how quickly Naviyd is transitioning into his teenage years. His fashion choices for the Autumn Winter 2022 Runway show impressed everyone. The young star confidently rocked stylish black-and-white plaid pants, a black T-shirt, a black cardigan with gold trimming, white sunglasses, and a modest chain around his neck.</p><p>Fans couldn’t help but also notice the striking resemblance between Naviyd and his famous father. Social media was abuzz with comments about the rapid growth of celebrity babies, with fans expressing their astonishment at Naviyd’s transformation.</p><p>However, despite the attention and admiration from fans and the media, Usher revealed that Naviyd was less impressed with the event than others were. According to the singer, his son acted cool and didn’t seem overly interested in being there.</p><p>Usher humorously noted that he understands why Naviyd might not want to be around older people, as he has been navigating the world of fame and being around older individuals since childhood as a former child star.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Naviyd_Ely_Raymonds_Parents_Relationship></span>Naviyd Ely Raymond’s Parents’ Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Naviyd Ely Raymond’s parents began their relationship in 2005. At that time, Naviyd’s mom was already a single mother to three sons from her previous relationship with Atlanta clothier Ryan Glover.</p><p>After two years of dating, Usher and Tameka were set to get<a href=#> married</a>, but Usher called off the wedding just an hour before the scheduled time, citing his unpreparedness for commitment. While this was unsettling for Naviyd’s mother, they worked it out.</p><p>A month later, on August 3, 2007, they had a small civil ceremony in Atlanta, Georgia. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Usher expressed his readiness for commitment, driven by his desire to take responsibility and not repeat his father’s mistakes.</p><p>The singer’s dad abandoned him when he was only seven years old. The couple held a grand party on September 1, 2007, at the Chateau Elan Winery and Resort near Atlanta to celebrate their marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/4cd419e6616f36504850ed2a81197705-fotor-2023070814155.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Naviyd_Ely_Raymonds_Parents_Divorced></span>Are Naviyd Ely Raymond’s Parents Divorced?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following a troubled relationship, Naviyd’s parents decided to separate in 2009 due to accusations of infidelity. The divorce process included a contentious custody battle that lasted for three years. However, on August 24, 2012, the judge granted Usher primary custody of his two sons from his marriage to Tameka.&nbsp;</p><p>Naviyd’s parents maintained a friendly and cooperative relationship with their children despite their differences. The separation was finalized on November 4, 2009.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Naviyd_Ely_Raymonds_Siblings></span>Naviyd Ely Raymond’s Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Naviyd has two half-brothers, Kile Glover and Ryan Glover, Jr., who are the sons of Tameka Foster and her ex-spouse, Ryan Glover. Naviyd’s older stepbrother, Kile, tragically passed away on July 21, 2012.</p><p>At 11, he was declared brain dead for 13 days following a watercraft accident on Lake Lanier. Kile’s final resting place is Arlington Memorial Park in Sandy Springs, Fulton County, Georgia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9b2ad1c1491bccda3ce68b737ee44759-fotor-20230708141639.jpg><p>In another distressing incident, Naviyd’s older half-brother, Usher “Cinco” Raymond V, who is 13 months older than him, had a near-death experience on August 5, 2013. He was involved in an incident where he became stuck in a pool drain at his father’s residence.</p><p>As a result, he was admitted to the ICU of a local hospital for medical care. It’s important to note that this incident occurred during a period when Usher and Tameka were already separated. These occurrences made Naviyd grateful for his loved ones and his life.</p><p>Another celebrity kid everyone is clamoring to know better is <a href=#>Aeko Catori Brown</a>. His resemblance with his father, Chris Brown, has fans talking.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ku6LCyLKbZp2crnqzrdimpqecXaKypsCMrqqhnaKoerS7zWauoaddmsOmvtiopZ5lp5a7tb%2BMraZmo56kxHA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnaviyd-ely-raymond-meet-ushers-son-who-everyone-wants-to-know.html&text=Naviyd%20Ely%20Raymond%3a%20Meet%20Ushers%20Son%2c%20Who%20Everyone%20Wants%20to%20Know&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnaviyd-ely-raymond-meet-ushers-son-who-everyone-wants-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnaviyd-ely-raymond-meet-ushers-son-who-everyone-wants-to-know.html&title=Naviyd%20Ely%20Raymond%3a%20Meet%20Ushers%20Son%2c%20Who%20Everyone%20Wants%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnaviyd-ely-raymond-meet-ushers-son-who-everyone-wants-to-know.html&title=Naviyd%20Ely%20Raymond%3a%20Meet%20Ushers%20Son%2c%20Who%20Everyone%20Wants%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnaviyd-ely-raymond-meet-ushers-son-who-everyone-wants-to-know.html&title=Naviyd%20Ely%20Raymond%3a%20Meet%20Ushers%20Son%2c%20Who%20Everyone%20Wants%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnaviyd-ely-raymond-meet-ushers-son-who-everyone-wants-to-know.html&description=Naviyd%20Ely%20Raymond%3a%20Meet%20Ushers%20Son%2c%20Who%20Everyone%20Wants%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nell-verlaque.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nell Verlaque Wiki, Bio, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Height, Age &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-bimbo-fairy-made-all-our-meme-dreams-come-true.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Bimbo Fairy Made All Our Meme Dreams Come True">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
