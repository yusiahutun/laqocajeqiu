From crying like babies for a whole minute to going through the garbage bin and counting the items, you will always find someone doing something that other people may interpret as weird. But in some cases, those embarrassing things you see someone doing is because the person is playing a truth and dare game with their friend. Such games can be awkward because your friend knows your weaknesses and will exploit them to embarrass you. So, if you are looking for embarrassing things to do in public, playing a truth and dare game with your friend is a great idea.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a8c06d0cabc92add.jpg><p class=align-left>Even if you are the calmest and composed person on earth, you have at some point fallen guilty to embarrassing behaviour. Many people are lucky because the acts happen in proximity to their friends. Since their friends understand them, they laugh it off and forget it seconds later.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a7d2bf07e664b4d5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Should I propose before or after dinner? How to do it the right way</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When the same thing happens in public, it becomes challenging to get over it, even to the point of being a memorable event. However, nowadays, people look for viral videos, and there are so many embarrassing things to do in public if you want to trend online.</p><h2>20 most embarrassing things to do in public</h2><p class=align-left>You have no short of options when it comes to doing the most awkward thing in front of people. So here is a list of embarrassing things you can do in public, either alone or with your friend, as you play the truth and dare game.</p><h3>1. Pick your nose in public</h3><p class=align-left>Undoubtedly, nose picking is an unseemly habit. But it is something many people do. The difference is many people do it when nobody else is watching. Picking your nose in public is embarrassing because it contributes to the shame of people around you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e974b1ad64e30313.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why do guys stare but never approach me?</span></p></a><h3>2. Eat your food with your mouth open</h3><p class=align-left>One of the most socially awkward things to do in public is eating with your mouth open. It is an embarrassing thing to do because humans learn about table manners and <a href=#>food</a> etiquette from a young age.</p><p class=align-left>The act itself will disgust the people around you, and some may even decide to leave the setting and go elsewhere. A brave person will tell you to eat with your lips shut. If it gets to this point, you will feel embarrassed.</p><h3>3. Fart loudly in a public elevator</h3><p class=align-left>If you want to embarrass someone, tell them to fart loudly in a public elevator. Flatulence is perfectly natural. Everybody does it at some point privately. But when it happens in public, especially in a tiny elevator with a few people, it becomes embarrassing.</p><p class=align-left>It does not matter whether it is loud, silent, or deadly. The act is a disaster in public, and people around you will look at you in disgust.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/37680e627e1181e2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to reject a girl politely without hurting her feelings</span></p></a><h3>4. Pick something in your teeth using your fingers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a7d2bf07e664b4d5.jpeg><p class=align-left>Picking the teeth is something most people do unconsciously. But doing it in public is embarrassing. If you are at an important <a href=#>business</a> lunch, a promising first date, or meeting your girlfriendâ€™s parents, picking your teeth is the last thing you should think of doing.</p><p class=align-left>They will interpret it as awkward, rude, and old-fashioned. Some may feel grossed and will not give you a handshake after that.</p><h3>5. Talk loudly on your phone about private matters</h3><p class=align-left>If you want someone to feel publicly embarrassed, tell them to talk loudly about personal matters on their <a href=#>phone</a>. For example, ask them to talk about sex because many people feel embarrassed about it in public.</p><p class=align-left>They will feel ashamed because individuals feel entitled not to hear anything that causes them to feel uncomfortable. So, talking about sex or things that are secret for you or other people is disquieting and embarrassing.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5aa879800d66801e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 biggest pet peeves in relationships that will drive you crazy</span></p></a><h3>6. Rub your armpits and smell your fingers</h3><p class=align-left>People already consider excessive underarm sweating as uncomfortable and annoying. Now, imagine rubbing your armpits and smelling your fingers in public. The act is not only embarrassing, but you will find yourself isolated.</p><p class=align-left>If you want to make it even more awkward, consider running for a short distance and sweating a bit. Then, go somewhere people are having a conversation or seated, rub our armpits, and smell your fingers in front of them.</p><h3>7. Sit on someoneâ€™s lap in public transportation</h3><p class=align-left>If you are on a bus or train with a few people, it only means that there are many empty seats around. The best way to make yourself embarrassed is to sit on someoneâ€™s lap, especially if you do not know them.</p><p class=align-left>You can take it a notch higher by wiggling your bum and pretending you want them. The reaction may be different depending on the person. You will feel embarrassed, or you may end up embarrassing the stranger.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9d6a07c31afb32ed.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 80 of the best weird quotes about real life</span></p></a><h3>8. Dance in public without any music</h3><p class=align-left>A funny embarrassment you can do with your friend is to dare them to dance in public without any music. But for this to work, your friend must be the type of person who is always afraid of doing things in public, particularly <a href=#>dancing</a>.</p><p class=align-left>You can make them feel even more embarrassed if they do not know how to dance. If the person lacks coordination, dancing without music will put them off-key and be a spectacle for others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e974b1ad64e30313.jpg><h3>9. Walk the whole day with your pantâ€™s zip open</h3><p class=align-left>Have you ever walked a short distance with your pantsâ€™ zip undone? Many people are never aware that their zips are open until somebody else points it out. As you walk around with your zip open, it becomes embarrassing, especially if everyone around you is looking at you.</p><h3>10. Talk to a wall and pretend to have a conversation</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e307adda0fd9ba6b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most rib-cracking love quotes of all time</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Embarrassing moments do not have to happen to you in a crowd. You are perfectly capable of embarrassing yourself when you are alone. Talking to a wall and pretending to have a conversation is embarrassing.</p><p class=align-left>Doing it in public is even worse because you will be making a fool of yourself. Many people around will find you insane because you cannot have a conversation with a wall. But the act is more entertaining if two people are playing the truth and dare game.</p><h3>11. Howl loudly like a wolf in a public square</h3><p class=align-left>Howling in public is similar to making noise. Many people consider it a cruel side effect of privilege and hubris. If you want to embarrass yourself, try howling at a quiet place like a library. All eyes will be on you.</p><p class=align-left>You can also do it at a public square where people are taking pictures or shooting videos. Chances are, you will find yourself trending online the following day.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhsh3j06p7a3g.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>6 tips on how to get over someone you like fast</span></p></a><h3>12. Ask a stranger to adopt you</h3><p class=align-left>One of the best examples of embarrassing moments you should try out is to ask a stranger to adopt you. The question about adoption is always awkward. It is something most people do not expect. You can do this by asking random people to embrace you.</p><p class=align-left>Alternatively, dare your friend to visit the next-door neighbour and tell them to ask the question. Finally, tell them to shout at everyone that they want someone to adopt them if you want it to have maximum impact.</p><h3>13. Ask for directions to the place you are already seated</h3><p class=align-left>Asking for directions is an excellent truth and dare idea to play with a male friend. Unlike women, men do not ask for directions because of their self-sufficiency trait. When a man asks for directions, it comes across as a flaw, an embarrassment, and a way of publicly putting himself in a dependent position.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs5r5q9thhs7s.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Memes about girls that will brighten your day</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He will want to figure things out for himself rather than ask for help. But if you are going to embarrass him further, dare him to ask for directions to his current location.</p><h3>14. Pay using a different currency</h3><p class=align-left>Dare your friend to go shopping and buy as many items as possible. Then, hand them a foreign currency that is of low value to the things they have purchased. At the counter, tell them to use the currency to pay for the items.</p><p class=align-left>Suppose the cashier refuses to take the money because it is of a different currency. In that case, your friend should pretend it is the accepted currency and has equal value to the items purchased.</p><h3>15. Search for money or credit card when it is time to pay</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/37680e627e1181e2.jpg><ul><li>If you want this form of embarrassment to work:</li><li>Consider putting items on a big trolley in a supermarket.</li><li>Ensure you have at least 50 items in the trolley.</li><li>Before you go to the cashier, wait until you see a long queue of people waiting for service.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs5889b2palj6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Life from a meme perspective</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When it is time to pay after the cashier has calculated the total value of the items, search aimlessly for the money or your credit card.</p><h3>16. Use coins to pay for an expensive item</h3><p class=align-left>Many cashiers or tellers want to serve as many people as possible within the shortest time. If you are going to embarrass yourself, buy an item worth around $300 and pay it using ten-cent or one-dollar coins, or a mixture of both.</p><p class=align-left>In the past, many establishments have prohibited their customers from paying with coins. But since it is legal tender and you want to embarrass yourself, go ahead and do it and look at the customers behind you.</p><h3>17. Talk to yourself loudly</h3><p class=align-left>People talk to themselves almost every day. Many do it under their breath or in their head. While you may consider the habit a bit strange, it is normal. However, you feel embarrassed if someone catches you red-handed.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs1k3g3p3pf878.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fun and hilarious truth or dare questions</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As one of the most embarrassing things many people do, the habit becomes worse when talking to yourself loudly in public. Congratulate yourself or talk about something people may find weird.</p><h3>18. Sing loudly off-key</h3><p class=align-left>One of the funny dares in public is to tell your friend to sing off-key in public. The person should use the wrong pitch for the notes in a popular <a href=#>song</a>. Also, make sure they sing in a pitchy, flat, and sharp voice.</p><p class=align-left>Even if your friend is good, many people around him will feel embarrassed for them. You will even see some of them shake their heads, run away, or plug their ears. An excellent place to embarrass your friend is to let them sing in a bar.</p><h3>19. Try summoning the rain in a public square</h3><p class=align-left>Traditionally, it is only the witches that summoned the rain. In the modern era, many people do not believe in witches anymore. So, when you want to embarrass yourself, try summoning the rain in a public square.</p><p class=align-left>People will look at you weirdly, and some may even run away from you. The act itself will look odd, especially if it fails to rain. Alternatively, try summoning the rain during a season when it never rains.</p><h3>20. Run in public, yelling you have lice</h3><p class=align-left>One of the most embarrassing things to say to people is you have lice. When you see lice, you keep quiet about it and deal with it on the down-low. But shouting it in public will only make people shun or run away from you.</p><p class=align-left>Some embarrassing things to do in public include talking to yourself loudly, asking a stranger to adopt you, farting in an elevator, or picking your nose. You can also play the truth and dare game where you ask your friend to howl loudly in the public square like a wolf or eat their food with their mouth open.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> published the top 20 most<a href=#> unique hobbies</a> that you can do at home in 2021.
