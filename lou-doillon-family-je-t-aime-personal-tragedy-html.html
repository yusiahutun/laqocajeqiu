We all experience life and death – the rest is a show for when the reality of life is too hard,' said Lou Doillon</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In the Palm Court of London’s Langham Hotel, the French singer Lou Doillon is mulling over the sauciest, and arguably most controversial, song ever committed to vinyl, Je T’Aime ... Moi Non Plus.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Her thoughts on the subject are significant, as it was Doillon’s mother who was responsible for the majority of the ecstatic groaning on the 1969 single, recorded, incidentally, just a negligée’s-throw from where the 33-year-old chanteuse now sits.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘My mother was and still is an exceptionally brave woman,’ she says of the English singer, actress and activist Jane Birkin OBE, after whom the iconic Hermès handbag was named.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I wasn’t interested so much in what she was singing in Je T’Aime… as the response it got from people. They were absolutely fascinated.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘My mum is mad but in the best way,’ she smiles, toothily looking eerily like Birkin.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘She is graceful in everything that she does – it’s a way of being for her. Unfortunately, I didn’t get that gene.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>That doesn’t appear to be the case this afternoon, as Doillon saunters through the lobby, all tousled tresses and bohemian chic.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>A former Pirelli calendar model and the face of Chloé and Givenchy, she is strikingly attractive and as cool as a Gauloises.&nbsp;</span></p><img id=i-406ef31b629f1ebb src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/18/15/3158591100000578-3452965-image-m-19_1455810975947.jpg height=407 width=634 alt="A young Lou Doillon with Jane Birkin, left, Serge Gainsbourg and their daughter Charlotte in 1985.&nbsp;‘My memory of Serge was mostly of having great fun.

People assume that we were just famous and wealthy, but what I remember is this hum of activity: at the piano, behind a camera, or sketching away with that look of concentration in their eyes.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'When I was small I thought the sexiest thing in the world was concentration.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The demi-monde would descend to work, drink and hang out with the intriguing Birkin and Gainsbourg.

He was very light and funny in person, but made serious points.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'He was extremely cultivated but pretended that he was not. There was always this crazy intellectual ping pong going on.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Serge is a difficult person to explain and I rarely try,’ she squints. ‘It’s difficult to grasp exactly what he was because, like his songs, there were so many layers to him. But he was never boring.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But there was darkness too. Gainsbourg was a troubled alcoholic who latterly became as famous for his obscene public outbursts as his provocative songwriting.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Birkin wasn’t as enigmatic to Doillon but, like Gainsbourg, she was a creative force of nature.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘My mother was directing her own films when women really didn’t do that sort of thing. She was decades ahead of her time.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Her parents separated when she was nine, as Birkin had become consumed with grief after Serge Gainsbourg died in 1991.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>This was compounded by the death of her father, a former Royal Navy lieutenant commander, in the same week.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Doillon went to stay with her father in France, living with Charlotte and her half-sister Kate Barry, from her mother’s first marriage, to the James Bond composer John Barry.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She would also spend holidays in north Wales at the home of her uncle, the British screenwriter Andrew Birkin, and his children.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Wales was wonderful, because we lived outside of society in a fantasy world of books and movies and music,’ she remembers.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Occasionally she’d visit London and stay with her grandmother Judy Campbell in Chelsea, a ‘wonderful, witty woman’ who was also Noël Coward’s muse.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I guess that involved being brilliant and inspirational,’ her granddaughter shrugs.</span></p><img id=i-cfeda92ca9c1019f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/18/15/315858F800000578-3452965-image-m-27_1455811087623.jpg height=536 width=634 alt="‘My mum is mad but in the best way.

When she was 19, her cousin Anno – Andrew Birkin’s son – died in a car crash in Milan; around the same time, Doillon became pregnant.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>A year later the child’s father, musician Thomas-John Mitchell, left her. Then in 2013 Kate Barry fell to her death from a fourth-floor window in Paris.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I’ve had my share of pain but I can’t just lie down and cry,’ she says.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Every moment of pain takes me closer to who I am. We all experience life and death – the rest is a show for when the reality of life is too hard.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>It comes as little surprise that Doillon’s music is shadow-strewn and brooding.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She sings in English, deploying a sonorous, slurred purr, the songs often dissecting loss and romantic despair.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Doillon’s debut folk pop album, Places, released in 2013, won Best Female Artist at Les Victoires de la Musique, the French version of the Brit Awards, making history by winning with a debut album.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Her second collection, Lay Low, is not for the faint-hearted. More intimate than its predecessor, lyrical themes include obsession, jealousy and shame.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She is as fêted for her unique style as for her unsettling songs. The current Vogue magazine has a piece on how to emulate Doillon’s dress sense. This amuses her, as she claims to have none.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I’m a bad plotter, in life and in dressing up, so I just throw clothes on,’ she confesses.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘The moment I start to overthink something, it goes wrong. So I don’t know how to create an image or advise others apart from “always get dressed in no more than three minutes”.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘After months of trying to decide what to do for an album cover, I took a selfie: no hair styling, no make-up. I’d literally just woken up. That was the image we ended up using. It’s honest, at least.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Today, she is kitted out in an Arran cardigan, a vintage velvet jacket, high-waisted jeans and flat black military boots.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I bought them yesterday,’ she says. ‘I’ve destroyed my others by taking them on tour. They’ve all gone a bit Artful Dodger.’</span></p><img id=i-76666e30e6a7aeed src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/18/16/3158590800000578-3452965-image-m-34_1455811214764.jpg height=1031 width=634 alt="‘The moment I start to overthink something, it goes wrong.

I tell Doillon that it is difficult to picture this firebrand eco-warrior babysitting like a regular grandmother.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘The kids definitely don’t go to her place to have a quiet evening,’ her daughter declares.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘It’s non-stop adventures: they’ve always been to see a three-hour play or have gone to five museums in one day.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Doillon’s son Marlowe, named after Elizabethan tragedian Christopher Marlowe, is now 13.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Does he hate me yet?’ Doillon wonders.&nbsp;‘I hope so! He’s very healthy.’&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She also speaks optimistically of a new boyfriend.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Tonight, Doillon will return to her family home in Paris’s 11th arrondissement, the fashionable area where the sickening IS attacks took place last November, before she and her band resume their world tour.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I was on stage in Normandy at the time of the attack,’ she shudders. ‘The Bataclan is at the heart of our musical community so we were all so worried.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'We had to wait until three o’clock in the morning to find out if some of our friends were alive. Those bars and cafes that were targeted are on the street where I live.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘But France loves to stand back up and it will do that again. It has a beautiful energy.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Doillon once cheerily complained that she couldn’t walk ten metres in Paris without being asked about her celebrated film-star sister Charlotte.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>As an actress, Doillon has appeared in more than 80 movies, but none of them broke any box-office records.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I was either too weird or had “too much character”,’ she sighs.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But now that her musical star is in the ascendant could Charlotte be just a little jealous of her sibling’s success?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I don’t think so,’ says Doillon. ‘And she wouldn’t say it if she was. Anyway,’ she adds, regaining her sang-froid, ‘we’re both doing so much we don’t have time to be jealous.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'We’re hard-working women.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic">‘Lay Low’ is out on March 4.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic">Doillon performs at Bush Hall, London, on April 27,&nbsp;<a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>wrasserecords.com</a></span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKCforJwsdWepa1nkafBqq%2FLnmRsbGVnhneBjoWmrmV0pLatuM6nZJ%2BZnZ65unmpnmSNZXGeuqZ5z56prKeelrluwNGanp6cqWO1tbnL</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flou-doillon-family-je-t-aime-personal-tragedy-html.html&text=Lou%20Doillon%20on%20family%2c%20Je%20TAime...%20and%20personal%20tragedy&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flou-doillon-family-je-t-aime-personal-tragedy-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flou-doillon-family-je-t-aime-personal-tragedy-html.html&title=Lou%20Doillon%20on%20family%2c%20Je%20TAime...%20and%20personal%20tragedy" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flou-doillon-family-je-t-aime-personal-tragedy-html.html&title=Lou%20Doillon%20on%20family%2c%20Je%20TAime...%20and%20personal%20tragedy" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flou-doillon-family-je-t-aime-personal-tragedy-html.html&title=Lou%20Doillon%20on%20family%2c%20Je%20TAime...%20and%20personal%20tragedy" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flou-doillon-family-je-t-aime-personal-tragedy-html.html&description=Lou%20Doillon%20on%20family%2c%20Je%20TAime...%20and%20personal%20tragedy" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./peter-krause.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Peter Krause Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pvc-latex-pants-trend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Wear the PVC, Patent, and Latex Pants Fashion Trend Like Kylie Jenner and Hailey Baldwin">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
