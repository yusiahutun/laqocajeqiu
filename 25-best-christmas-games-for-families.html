One Of The Best Christmas Games for Families.</p><p>How to play: Separate into teams of three or four and give each team a bag filled with materials to make a Santa outfit from. The best materials to use are red, white and black streamers and tissue paper, cotton wool balls and any fun extras like fur or glitter. , Give the teams 5 minutes to create a Santa outfit, making it as good as they possibly can. When the time runs out, both teams take it in turns to do a catwalk of their creation and the parents can judge which one is best.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZH92ecGeqq1lk52%2Fqr%2FTppisZZeWuqa%2FjJ%2Bmq2WWlrqquMieqg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f25-best-christmas-games-for-families.html&text=25%20Best%20Christmas%20Games%20for%20Families&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f25-best-christmas-games-for-families.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f25-best-christmas-games-for-families.html&title=25%20Best%20Christmas%20Games%20for%20Families" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f25-best-christmas-games-for-families.html&title=25%20Best%20Christmas%20Games%20for%20Families" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f25-best-christmas-games-for-families.html&title=25%20Best%20Christmas%20Games%20for%20Families" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f25-best-christmas-games-for-families.html&description=25%20Best%20Christmas%20Games%20for%20Families" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./4-benefits-being-brand-ambassador.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="4 Best Tips To Become a brand ambassador">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./royal-mint-launches-harry-potter-29236400.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Royal Mint launches Harry Potter 50p coins to mark 25 years since first book">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
