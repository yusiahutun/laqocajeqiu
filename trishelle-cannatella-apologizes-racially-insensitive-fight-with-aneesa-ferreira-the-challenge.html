Ferreira memorably referred to her costar as "Trashelle," before Cannatella starting calling Aneesa a "f---ing stripper." Things then got physical, before Trishelle quit the next morning, never to return. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She'd later claim</a> that her exit wasn't purely because of the Aneesa confrontation, but because she also didn't feel like it was a safe production overall.</p><p>With "The Challenge: All Stars" reuniting them on camera for the first time since that spat, the two sat down to hash out their past on this week's new episode of the Paramount+ series.</p><p>"I wanted to talk to you the first night that we got here, but a lot was going on and everybody was crazy or whatever," Trishelle said to her costar. "I know that I haven't seen you in forever and the last show that we did was not the best ending."</p><p>In a confessional, Cannatella said the "only regret" she has about her last MTV appearance was "how I left it with Aneesa" following their fight. "It's weighing on my heart and I want to get it into the open," she added.</p><p>"I felt so terrible after," she continued to tell Aneesa. "I know that it was a long time ago but I know that it hurt your feelings and I just wanted to personally apologize to you just face-to-face because it was racially insensitive and I never would want to say anything to hurt you because you're amazing."</p><p>At that point, both women started to choke up, as Aneesa said the apology "makes me so emotional." Added Trishelle, "Just know I am sorry and it won't happen again."</p><p>"I totally accept that and I'm happy you said it to me," said Ferreira. "It was so long ago but I forgave you so long ago. This was 9 years ago, which doesn't make it right, but we've both grown. You apologizing to me means everything."</p><p>The two then exchanged hugs and "I love yous."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/42/16by9/2021/03/29/421550c5c72c404693eee565adac2d6f_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>"It's unfortunate that we had that hiccup 9 years ago because we could have had a great friendship," said Aneesa in a confessional. "Trishelle and I are going to be fine. it feels like she isn't that person and I truly believe in giving people the room to grow."</p><p>In her own confessional, Trishelle doubled down on how "wrong," "immature" and "stupid" she was in the past. "Since then, I have educated myself and I want to be a better person and a better human," she added. "Aneesa was just so incredibly kind to me and I feel like I've learned a lot from it. I really appreciate that she's accepted my apology."</p><p><a href=#>Speaking with TooFab</a> ahead of the season premiere, Cannatella said she was "so humiliated and horrified by the things that I said to Aneesa and just my exit." She also admitted she was "really nervous to see [Ferreira] because of this past that we have" before they reunited on "All Stars" -- but made sure to say Aneesa was 100% justified in her actions during their altercation.</p><p>While she and Aneesa patched things up, it wasn't all rainbows for Trishelle during filming. "I did have a conflict with someone who I was really good friends with," she told TooFab, "and we actually still have not spoken, which is a bummer." When we asked about a fight between her and good friend Katie Cooley that appears in the trailer for the season, Cannatella would only said that it "wasn't a picnic."</p><p>New episodes of "The Challenge: All Stars" drop Thursdays on Paramount+.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:db0932b2-1982-4093-a44c-1f85dcf9abd9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:e9a8327a-ff92-406d-acf9-1a7920cf5707 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/70/5by4/2021/03/30/70f7925db8fd4739805306cdcd735622_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Paramount+</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">The Challenge: All Stars Led to Major Friend Fallout for Trishelle Cannatella (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j21maXBfqb%2Bqv8eeo6WdXZiur7rArZylpJFirrG7y6ieorKVqHqzrcKimKWkqWK2r7%2FEp6qirJmrsm6yyKCfrWWnnsGpecCnnJ6rkWKzpr7RnqCrmV2ptaZ5wqGYpaSVo7Smew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftrishelle-cannatella-apologizes-racially-insensitive-fight-with-aneesa-ferreira-the-challenge.html&text=Trishelle%20Cannatella%20Apologizes%20For%20%27Racially%20Insensitive%27%20Fight%20With%20Aneesa%20Ferreira%20On%20The%20Challen&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftrishelle-cannatella-apologizes-racially-insensitive-fight-with-aneesa-ferreira-the-challenge.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftrishelle-cannatella-apologizes-racially-insensitive-fight-with-aneesa-ferreira-the-challenge.html&title=Trishelle%20Cannatella%20Apologizes%20For%20%27Racially%20Insensitive%27%20Fight%20With%20Aneesa%20Ferreira%20On%20The%20Challen" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftrishelle-cannatella-apologizes-racially-insensitive-fight-with-aneesa-ferreira-the-challenge.html&title=Trishelle%20Cannatella%20Apologizes%20For%20%27Racially%20Insensitive%27%20Fight%20With%20Aneesa%20Ferreira%20On%20The%20Challen" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftrishelle-cannatella-apologizes-racially-insensitive-fight-with-aneesa-ferreira-the-challenge.html&title=Trishelle%20Cannatella%20Apologizes%20For%20%27Racially%20Insensitive%27%20Fight%20With%20Aneesa%20Ferreira%20On%20The%20Challen" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftrishelle-cannatella-apologizes-racially-insensitive-fight-with-aneesa-ferreira-the-challenge.html&description=Trishelle%20Cannatella%20Apologizes%20For%20%27Racially%20Insensitive%27%20Fight%20With%20Aneesa%20Ferreira%20On%20The%20Challen" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-conky-for-linux-desktop.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Conky, and How Can It Make Your Linux Desktop Look Amazing?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./man-blasted-admitting-spends-2-000-month-bottled-water-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Man is blasted for admitting that he spends $2,000 a month on bottled water">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
