Vince Jetter was youth director of Bethel AME Church in Clinton and founded the community center in 1992.</p><p>After his <a href=#>death in 2006</a>, his sister Dina White and family members kept the center open, until repairs became costly and renovation necessary. With a renovated facility, the Vince Jetter Community Center can develop mentoring, after-school enrichment and homework help programs at the center, create a village spirit to guide youth and families and encourage positive neighborhood and community connections, Rachel Jetter said.</p><p>“Vince Jetter Community Center will become a safe, nurturing space where underserved youth will have the opportunity to learn self care, communication and life coping skills in a supportive, positive environment from understanding guides where they may grow and thrive,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/03/T-Mobile.png><p>“We have goals, dreams and aspirations of providing the light for a brighter community in Clinton. This partnership will serve as a tremendous resource for us to complete renovation of the community center and accomplish our mission and goals.”</p><p>The <a href=#>T-Mobile Hometown Grant recipients</a>, with 275 communities across 46 states, are part of the exclusive crew that will receive funding and support to fuel local projects that help people connect and innovate, according to the telecommunications company. And since providing more than $12 million in Hometown Grants since the “Un-carrier” kicked off its&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>five-year commitment</a>&nbsp;to small towns in April 2021, the T-Mobile is well on its way to hitting the program’s $25 million mark.</p><p>Clinton’s Vince Jetter Community Center has a special commitment to inspiring positive neighborhood solutions, Rachel Jetter said Thursday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/03/Jetter3.png><p>“By empowering individuals, families and groups, and changing lives, we strive to make Clinton a better place by creating a safe, nonviolent, nurturing place for Clinton’s youth and their families to grow,” she said. “Our vision is promoting equality, equity and diversity for all. Our board is committed to respecting differences, acknowledging individuality and amplifying all voices. A culture of inclusivity empowers individuals at every level to enrich communities, one family at a time.”</p><p><strong>What are center programs?</strong></p><h2 class=inline-related-stories__heading>4 MORE</h2><ul class=inline-related-stories__list><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Vince Jetter Community Center, Clinton, earns grant">Vince Jetter Community Center, Clinton, earns grant</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Clinton closes street for emergency water main repairs">Clinton closes street for emergency water main repairs</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Riverbend Bicycle Club, Clinton, hosts annual ride">Riverbend Bicycle Club, Clinton, hosts annual ride</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Wilderness Art Project | Clinton County Conservation">Wilderness Art Project | Clinton County Conservation</a></h3></li></ul><p>Vince Jetter’s community spirit and legacy lives on through many programs, including:</p><ul><li>A mentoring program for Black girls called “I am…” begins this spring.
