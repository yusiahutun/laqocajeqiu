After starting her career modelling for make-up legend Pat McGrath, Paloma has ascended the fashion industry, campaign after campaign, catwalk after catwalk, creating the space and telling the story for women who didn’t fit the mould and with it, breaking boundaries.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2023, she became the first curve model to receive the coveted Model of the Year at the Fashion Awards, but it didn’t come without controversy. When Internet naysayers undermined her win, Elsesser took a step away from social media for a moment of clarity.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She’s now back, with renewed energy and purpose — collaborating with long-time supporters Ganni on a seven-piece collection (first teased by Elsesser on the SS24 runway) that comes in a fully extended size range of EU 32-52, underpinning Elsesser’s stance of representation and body inclusivity across the board. The collection also marks the model’s foray into different creative industries as she continues to redefine what it means to be a supermodel.</p><img alt="a person in a dress" title="Paloma Elsesser" width=2500 height=3771 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/000069870011-661706cf7efdc.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lee Mary Manning</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Lynette Nylander</strong>: You hosted the Fashion Scholarship Fund gala last night and it was pretty star-studded. Tracee Ellis Ross, Spike Lee, Vera Wang were all there, but I actually want to start with what you were wearing last night, because it was so good!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Paloma Elsesser:</strong> I was in Vaquera last night.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LN: </strong>How did you choose that look? Who chose it?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>PE:</strong> My stylist, Aly Cooper<strong>. </strong>I work with the iconic fashion editor (and Bazaar’s Style Director At Large) Carlos Nazario, and I work with Aly as well — they’re now working together on other projects that we’ll be doing all together. So last night was kind of a reflection of both Aly and my interests, and then obviously the beauty and fun of fashion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LN: </strong>I feel you've never been confined by what you “should” wear. I know that you said the vintage expert Gabriel Held told you he thought about vintage fashion in a completely new way with you, because you’re able to alter and manipulate how bodies like yours dress. I want you to talk a little bit about that because I think it's really interesting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>PE:</strong> As a young kid, I didn't understand fashion as a business, as an industry, but I loved clothes and style. I was always really obsessed with and curious about manipulating what I wanted to wear to befit my style. I didn't grow up with a lot of financial privilege and at the time I didn't feel bodily privilege, being in a bigger body, surrounded by a lot of thin people. So if I wanted to wear Limited Too, I had to figure out how to get the top, but get the pants from the boys section.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I've been doing that for a long time, but you can ask any of my oldest friends: I never felt that I had to subscribe to what bigger bodies “should '' wear. It just has never been the way that I've oriented. I too respond to trends. I too respond to the zeitgeist, and have the same interests and ideas as thinner-bodied people, but I just make them work for my body.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I remember being in the fourth grade and being obsessed with Siouxsie and the Banshees and not really seeing a chunky brown girl emulating their style. But then I was like, "Oh, I want to dress punk." I could go to the adult section, because I was bigger, at this really iconic store on Melrose called Redballs<strong>. </strong>It's not open anymore, but it had fuzzy raver stuff and punk stuff and goth stuff. It was this amazing storefront on Melrose that was covered in these shiny silver balls.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“I too respond to trends...but I just make them work for my body.” <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LN: </strong>Yeah, I am Googling it. It looks amazing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>PE:</strong> Yeah, it was. And then I would force my dad to take me to Sportie LA, which was down the street. I saw boys wearing Etnies and would think ‘I want to wear those.’ I think now as an adult who understands fashion as a business and also has an appreciation for archive and for a lot of things that generally weren't designed, quote-unquote, “for me” or my body type, I'm like, "Okay, well, I'll make it as such."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LN:</strong> That leads me perfectly to your collaboration with Ganni. How did you meet Ditte Reffstrup, their creative director, and how did the collaboration come to be?</p><img alt="a woman in a black dress holding a large white balloon" title="Ganni x Paloma collab" width=1156 height=1445 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/240325-gannixpaloma-ma-sh02-283-rgb-661707d77970a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Marili Andre</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>PE:</strong> I met Ditte in 2020. I had closed their show. We have a funny backstory because I was violently ill. I was throwing up in line up, but still just went out there and did it. It was a nice origin story for us. If you've had the privilege of getting to know the Ganni team, which I know you have, they're very real. They're fun, they're cool, they're honest. After that they were interested in the collaboration and making a really special moment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For me, it was an absolute no-brainer. I think my relationship with Ganni and all of the internal team — Alexandra, Ditte, everyone — has been great and they've shown me such warmth. I also think that from a business lens, they're also a brand that has been doing extended sizing. It's not as if I'm launching their first foray into this, which I also think is really organic and honest.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We have similar worldviews, similar values, and similar perspectives. I think it's really easy and natural to partner with a brand like that. That's why when the idea was brought up, I was like, "Absolutely, yes." They're like, "How do we make this? Then, you can wear it on the runway and it'll be the first tease." It’s been such a joyful process.</p><img alt="a woman with curly hair" title="Ganni x Paloma collab" width=751 height=939 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/240325-gannixpaloma-ma-sh06-079-rgb-6617089ec8bc0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Marili Andre</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LN: </strong>Scandinavian style — I do think those girls have it so together. It's always good. There are no badly dressed people in Copenhagen that I've seen. Do you agree?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>PE:</strong> I think what I see, again, really embodies the essence of what I love about style. People really make things their own. There's a fearlessness and sense of fun. Life is very textured, and I think that clothes should be a salve to the texture, and in Copenhagen, not only is the quality of life there great, but the clothes show that their quality of life is fabulous.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LN:</strong> Who have you long looked to for style influence?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>PE:</strong> So many people. I think I used to feel really overwhelmed with, like, "Oh my God, who am I going to be today?" Now it's more fun. I'm inspired by my friends and just inspired by a fearlessness in dressing. I love when people take something and interpret it as their own. It's always inspiring to me, adding a bit of quirk to things, a bit of a twist, a bit of subversion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LN: </strong>Let's talk a little bit about the collection. What was the intention behind it?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>PE:</strong> I used to go to Copenhagen when I first started modelling and I worked with e-comm for a plus size brand. I had a little coin, and I remember going to the Ganni store that was not that far from where the hotel was always, and being like, "Oh, this brand is so cute." I loved that they didn't sacrifice quality in exchange for having the brand feel more accessible. Obviously, it's not cheap by any means, but it’s at a more accessible price point.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I also felt like Ganni really captured the essence of girlhood or personhood that I allied with. I want to be able to go to the office, then to dinner, then go to a party, and then maybe if I take off the jacket, I can go to a rave. I want to be able to do all these things in one day. I feel like the Ganni girl, or the Ganni person, is really that. So, the SKUs in the collection are meant to mirror all of those thoughts around who she is, how she lives her life. There's ease, there's sexiness, there's mystery, there's toughness. There's all of these people that we get to be in our multitudes. Also, it was about reflecting on how the Ganni girl is becoming a Ganni woman. That's something that I really wanted to lean into and the team is really excited about.</p><img alt="a person in a dress" title="a person in a dress" width=1333 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/07-f9443-6753-523-2-6617090ac4877.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">courtesy of Ganni</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LN: </strong>It seems like an evolution of your platform, in a way. So much of being a model is being a vessel for someone else's thoughts and creativity, but I feel like in the last couple of years you've really stood on your own and brought your own creative perspective to the forefront. I want to talk about whether you feel you align with that, if you feel that that's important. Is there more that you want to do?</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“I'm still a human and it's scary and I have imposter syndrome, but I've built self-esteem...”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>PE: </strong>I think there's actually something very powerful in doing something I've never done before. During this whole week of the eclipse and stepping into new roles and new powers and things I've been abstinent from. I think that I always knew or hoped that modelling would provide a platform. I never dreamt of being a model, period, but once I knew that this was the path I was going on, I wondered how I was going to be able to bring in all of the things that I value into this incredibly privileged and rarefied job.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I'm still a human and it's scary and I have imposter syndrome, but I've built self-esteem through estimable acts both internally and externally. So, I think these next chapters are really just about extending the tenets of why I do what I do, why I model. It's just to form connections and create a little bit of space for interest. I'm obviously not for everyone, but everyone's not for me. So, I'm excited to expand what that conversation looks like for me through writing, consultancy stuff, obviously modelling, and being a bit more of a collaborator in image and design! It's scary being a boss.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Highlights from the Autumn/Winter 2024 fashion weeks" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hbz-aw24-highlights-thumb-1-65f33699d960e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wG9nbW5haYBxe8%2Bao6ilkWKyrb%2FErKqeql2eu7Wx0a%2Bgnq9f</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpaloma-elsesser-interview.html&text=Paloma%20Elsesser%20on%20collaborating%20with%20Ganni&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpaloma-elsesser-interview.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpaloma-elsesser-interview.html&title=Paloma%20Elsesser%20on%20collaborating%20with%20Ganni" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpaloma-elsesser-interview.html&title=Paloma%20Elsesser%20on%20collaborating%20with%20Ganni" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpaloma-elsesser-interview.html&title=Paloma%20Elsesser%20on%20collaborating%20with%20Ganni" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpaloma-elsesser-interview.html&description=Paloma%20Elsesser%20on%20collaborating%20with%20Ganni" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./pat-finley-bio-wiki-age-height-family-husband-kids-movies-tv-shows-alive-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pat Finley Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Husband, Kids, Movies, Tv Shows, Alive and Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./myimgur-lets-image-host-desktop-windows.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="MyImgur Lets You Use The Best Image Host Right From Your Desktop [Windows]">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
