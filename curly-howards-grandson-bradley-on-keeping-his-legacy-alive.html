He brought stuff to the table that was beyond what anyone else was doing.”</p><p>Curly’s sweetly goofy Stooges persona contradicted his real life as a four-time married ladies’ man. “My grandfather was very outgoing when he was in public,” Bradley says. “He loved to go out and have his drinks and cigars.” There was also a softer side to Curly, who doted on his children and was a great friend to animals. “When he wasn’t on the road performing, he’d be in his backyard with his dogs. He always had dogs,” says Bradley, whose mother, Marilyn Ellman, recalled Curly as kind but busy during his peak Hollywood years. “She remembers getting a lot of presents from him,” says Bradley. “He was very generous and a good dad, but he was on the road so much. They were extremely popular, so she didn’t see him a lot when she was a kid.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/curly-howards-grandson-bradley-on-keeping-his-legacy-alive.jpg><h2>Fans Forever</h2><p>Bradley’s grandmother told him he was Curly’s descendant when he was 5. “It was a shock,” admits Bradley, who notes that he and his brother inherited some of Curly’s knack for performing. “We were both at the top of our choir. My brother is also an extremely talented self-taught piano player,” he says. “We were born with gifts that come from Curly. There is something very special running through our veins.”</p><p>Though Bradley never met his grandfather Curly, who died in 1952 at age 48 after a long convalescence, he’s made an effort to connect with other descendants of the Three Stooges. “When I went to my first Stooges convention, I met my Aunt Joan, who is Moe’s daughter. I call her my aunt, but she is actually a cousin,” says Bradley, who has also become close with relatives of Larry and Shemp. “It all happened organically.”</p><p>Today, Bradley carries on his <a href=#>grandfather’s legacy on YouTube</a>, where he hosts Stooge Talk Live on Thursdays. He also participated in The Three Stooges in the Fast Lane, a 2023 show on the YouTube channel The Three Stooges+. “We feel like we’re giving back by promoting slapstick comedy,” Bradley explains. “People absolutely adore what we’re doing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46crKukqWK1sMPAq5usZZenrq%2Bw0qilZpqilrGtsdhmpqdlm5qysbXNoGShoaNiuaazwJywZpmcnsOmew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcurly-howards-grandson-bradley-on-keeping-his-legacy-alive.html&text=Curly%20Howards%20Grandson%20Bradley%20Is%20Keeping%20His%20Brilliant%20Grandfathers%20Three%20Stooges%20Legac&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcurly-howards-grandson-bradley-on-keeping-his-legacy-alive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcurly-howards-grandson-bradley-on-keeping-his-legacy-alive.html&title=Curly%20Howards%20Grandson%20Bradley%20Is%20Keeping%20His%20Brilliant%20Grandfathers%20Three%20Stooges%20Legac" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcurly-howards-grandson-bradley-on-keeping-his-legacy-alive.html&title=Curly%20Howards%20Grandson%20Bradley%20Is%20Keeping%20His%20Brilliant%20Grandfathers%20Three%20Stooges%20Legac" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcurly-howards-grandson-bradley-on-keeping-his-legacy-alive.html&title=Curly%20Howards%20Grandson%20Bradley%20Is%20Keeping%20His%20Brilliant%20Grandfathers%20Three%20Stooges%20Legac" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcurly-howards-grandson-bradley-on-keeping-his-legacy-alive.html&description=Curly%20Howards%20Grandson%20Bradley%20Is%20Keeping%20His%20Brilliant%20Grandfathers%20Three%20Stooges%20Legac" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./harry-warner-and-rea-levinson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Harry Warner and Rea Levinson">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bruce-somers-jr.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bruce Somers Jr. -Bio, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Career, Facts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
