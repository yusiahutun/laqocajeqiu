accommodations and tickets for friends and family make the evening a costly one.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>However, one thing the ladies do not have to worry about paying for though are their male escorts for the evening.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In the past, they were provided by West Point but now must be obtained by the families of the young women, though the Ball's directors are happy to help with that task.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>To be selected for the ball, debutantes must be 'women of distinction', who come from&nbsp;well-connected families, and are accomplished in&nbsp;</span>athletics, community service, academics, philanthropy and charity.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>THE HISTORY OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEBUTANTE BALL</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>One of the Vanderbilts started it all by noting that in the jet age, it’s a small world.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Reminiscing about her own debut, Consuelo Vanderbilt, future wife of the Duke of Marlborough, recalled it took two weeks for her to get to England for her debut, then another seven or eight days of exhausting travel to Paris for another ball in her honor.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Girls don’t realize what a wonderful opportunity they have to fly around the globe to attend each other’s parties,' said Vanderbilt.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>That remark sparked Beatrice Dinsmore Joyce, a New York Socialite with a dramatic flair for parties and pageantry, to create the first international Debutante Ball as a charity.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Today The International Ball Foundation helps support many charities including The Soldiers’, Sailors’, Marines’, Coast Guard and Airmen’s Club, a home away from home for the military and their families.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>That first ball was held in 1954 and soon the annual event became a highlight of the winter social season. Traditionally, at the ball, each debutante is presented while accompanied by two escorts – a young man dressed in white tie and an assigned member from the Naval, Coast Guard, Air Force or Norwich Military Academy, who carries the flag or the country or state the debutante represents.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Lester Lanin and his orchestra have played appropriate music as each debutante is introduced to hundreds of guests who contribute to the Ball’s beneficiaries.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The International Debutante Ball provides a social context where young women and men from all over the world meet one another, have a wonderful and romantic time, and form lasting friendships.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Over the past decades, daughters of Diplomats, Ambassadors, Governors, Presidents, ancient European titles and distinguished Americans from all over the country have been brought together by the Ball and the various parties associated with it.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#><span class=mol-style-italic></span></a></span></p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/femail/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Read More:</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Kate's most expensive fashion year yet!
