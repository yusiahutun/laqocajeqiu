Wes Studi has his share of the rough ride in his family life, but still, there are no scratches on his family bond.</p><p>Well, if you want to explore Wes Studi's family bond, you don't have to go anywhere.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Explore every fresh and exciting thing of your beloved celebrity&nbsp;Wes Studi on the five facts presented below!</p><h3>1) Wes Studi is an Inside Out Cherokee!</h3><p>Born in Nofire Hollow, Oklahoma, USA, on December 17, 1947,&nbsp; Wes Studi&nbsp;is full Cherokee from his heart to soul. The eldest son of Maggie, a housekeeper and Andy Studie, a ranch hand, Studi spoke only Cherokee before he attended grade school. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Studi later <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">attended</a> Tulsa Junior College in Tulsa, Oklahoma, U.S. and Northeastern State University, Oklahoma, U.S.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The 70 years old actor, Studi might share the ultimate love for his Cherokee <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ethnicity</a> that he even went to marry a Cherokee school teacher, Rebecca Graves.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h3>2) Wes Studi Scored Hattrick in Marriage!</h3><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>You may already know that Wes Studi is married, but do you know that he has not been married once or&nbsp;twice, but thrice?&nbsp;</p><p>Well, Studi never took his first marriage seriously as he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> it was short and not a real marriage. It might be one of the reasons for keeping his first marriage low-key.</p><p>Well, the actor, who stands at the height of 5’ 10” (1.78m), got married for the second time to a school teacher, Rebecca Graves in 1974.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>And the actor started a family with Rebecca sharing two children, Daniel, age 42, and Leah, age 38. The pair even&nbsp;bought a horse ranch near Tulsa. However, Studi’s second marriage’s run came to an end after the divorce in 1982.</p><p></p><p><strong>Caption:&nbsp;Wes Studi, his wife Maura Dhu Studi, and son Kholan Studi at the premiere of Entertainment Motion Pictures on December 14, 2017.</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: Getty Images</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>But it was not the end to the quirks of Studi’s love life. He gave a third chance to love when he met Maura, daughter of Jack Albertson,&nbsp;back in 1988.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He was in the pursuit of his acting career where the fate struck Studi to meet his lady love in a jazz club in Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Maura, the wife of Wes Studi, recalls the incident as, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“As far as I was concerned, it was love at first sight.”</p><p>The first meeting was not enough for Wes as they didn’t go out for another year. But the love ultimately took them to marriage, and then the pair welcomed a child named Kholan Garret.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-186 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>After marrying&nbsp;Maura, Studi enjoyed a blissful family life with his wife, son Kholan, and Daniel. However,&nbsp;Leah stayed back with her mother, Rebecca.</p><h3>3) Divorce was the ultimate push that drove Studi to acting!</h3><p>No wonder, Studi&nbsp;has a little complex married life that will inevitably output complications in its own way. But the divorce incident became the button that pushed him to acting&nbsp;and film industry.&nbsp;As the actor himself explains,</p><p>“I had to build another life.”</p><p>The actor joined the American Indian Theater Company (Tulsa) in 1983, a year after divorcing Rebecca.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Three years later, he shifted to Los Angeles and&nbsp;made his film debut in the 1988 film “Powwow Highway” which opened the gate for the series of roles for him.&nbsp;</p><p>As per Studi's interview in 1993, he was trying to explore more than his ethnic-roles. Well, his major career work includes Geronimo, The Last of the Mohicans. &nbsp;</p><h3>4) Wes Studi’s Talents Run High and Wide!</h3><p>The small-town Oklahoma native, Studi, invested a lot of his talents to attain the title of highly acclaimed actors.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-630 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But before he even came as an actor, he already had the compilation of real-life credits of soldier, reporter, and activist. He joined the U.S. Army back in 1967&nbsp;and served&nbsp;in Vietnam for 18 months.</p><p>In the year 1974, he worked as a reporter, right after returning from Army.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-native_bottom"></span><p>As for activist, he was one of the protesters on the “Trail of Broken Treaties protest March” in 1972.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-native_bottom"></span><h3>Do you know that Studi is also a musician?</h3><p>Studi is the bass player in the band “Firecat of Discord” where his wife Maura is the lead singer while his brother, Bob&nbsp;is the drummer.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p><strong>Caption: Wes Studi with his band&nbsp;“Firecat of Discord” at the Ryman Auditorium. (Published on Jul 26, 2009 )</strong></p><p>Studi has not just flaunted his talents in music but has also given his writing skills to the world from his two children books for the Cherokee Bilingual Cross-Cultural Education Center.</p><h3>5) Wes Studi Wished His Kids to Follow his Footsteps!</h3><p>The well-beloved actor, Wes Studi,&nbsp;wished his children to follow his footsteps of acting. The actor, who gathered all sorts of fame and fortune from the profession,&nbsp;hinted his wish on&nbsp;Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>The actor shared a throwback <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">photo</a> with his children on his facebook where he revealed his desire in the comment section after one of his fans&nbsp;asked him whether he would allow his kids to go into acting or not.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Caption - Wes Studi's reply to the children going to acting career question</strong></p><p>Photo Credit - Wes Studi's facebook</p><p>As a good father, Wes Studi replied back yes which further&nbsp;shows the ultimate love for his family and children.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, Leah is now already&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a> to Jake and shares a child. However, she hasn't pursued an acting career.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-653 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZrCdo2LAtcHDomSwoZaaeqetzKKjsmWVqbWvtcKiq7JlkZyybrXNrZyrrpmaxG%2B006aj</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwes-studi-wife-family-ethnicity-age-interview-html.html&text=Wes%20Studi%20Still%20in%20Strong%20Family%20Bond%20with%20Wife%21%205%20Facts%20on%20His%20Personal%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwes-studi-wife-family-ethnicity-age-interview-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwes-studi-wife-family-ethnicity-age-interview-html.html&title=Wes%20Studi%20Still%20in%20Strong%20Family%20Bond%20with%20Wife%21%205%20Facts%20on%20His%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwes-studi-wife-family-ethnicity-age-interview-html.html&title=Wes%20Studi%20Still%20in%20Strong%20Family%20Bond%20with%20Wife%21%205%20Facts%20on%20His%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwes-studi-wife-family-ethnicity-age-interview-html.html&title=Wes%20Studi%20Still%20in%20Strong%20Family%20Bond%20with%20Wife%21%205%20Facts%20on%20His%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwes-studi-wife-family-ethnicity-age-interview-html.html&description=Wes%20Studi%20Still%20in%20Strong%20Family%20Bond%20with%20Wife%21%205%20Facts%20on%20His%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-a-one-handed-keyboard.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is a One-Handed Keyboard, and When Is It Better?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./full-match-replay-angel-city-fc-vs-washington-spirit.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch National Women's Soccer League Season 2022 Episode 141: Angel City FC vs. Washington Spirit">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
