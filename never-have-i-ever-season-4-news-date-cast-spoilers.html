After two seasons that saw Sherman Oaks student Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) balance high school romance and familial grief, season 3 followed the overachiever as she learns to love herself during her short-lived romances with her big crush Paxton (Darren Barnet) and new addition Des (Anirudh Pisharody).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By the end of the season, Devi makes two huge decisions: to stay in Sherman Oaks with her friends and family for senior year, and to lose her virginity to enemy-turned-possible-lover Ben (Jaren Lewison). The season ends before we see whether Devi and Ben hook up, but new episodes are already on the way. Read on for what we know about Devi's final year of high school, and the Netflix hit's final season.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Never Have I Ever season 4 will premiere on June 8, 2023.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Netflix has announced that the comedy's final season will arrive this June, just in time for graduation season (but also so soon!). The new trailer looks back on the past three seasons of Devi's high school experience, before showing some peeks forward to prom, graduation, and a new potential romance for Devi as she gets close with new character Ethan (Michael Cimino).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Co-creators Kaling and Fisher previously revealed in March 2022 that the fourth season of the teen dramedy will be its last, in a signed note addressed to the show's fans.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We've just been renewed for a fourth and final season, which we are absolutely thrilled about," the statement reads. "We can't wait to reveal all the steamy romance and hilarious adventures we have in store for you. Thanks to all our fans for your support – especially you #Bevi and #Daxton stans. We love you!"</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Kaling says ending the show after four seasons "makes sense."</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/tv/why-never-have-i-ever-will-end-with-season-4/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Tonight" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Entertainment Tonight</a>, Kaling opened up about the decision to end the series with Devi's high school graduation, rather than continuing the series via the common trope where a teen show has all of their characters go to the same college.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Four seasons for a high school show felt like it made sense," she said "They can’t be in high school forever. We've seen those shows. Like, you've been in high school for 12 years. What is going on here? Also, the actors get older and it starts looking insane that a 34-year-old is playing a 15-year-old."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"So there are some things are built-in doing a high school show that felt like, OK this is time," she added. "But the truth is, we got to know the characters. The great thing about doing it on Netflix is that we got to tell stories that you wouldn’t necessarily be able to tell in traditional network shows and so we feel good. We really told the story of this 15-year-old girl and that felt like the perfect amount of time."</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Filming for Season 4 is already done.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The final episodes of Never Have I Ever were filmed earlier this year, with production wrapping for good in early August. Per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a40516533/maitreyi-ramakrishnan-never-have-i-ever-season-3-cast-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Elle class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Elle</a>, the series wrap party included a cast-hosted carnival, where Fisher and Ramakrishnan both gave send-off speeches, and a blooper real showed memories of the past three years of filming.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jaren Lewison told the outlet that she show's final season is "perfect." He added, "I think the way the writers approached this fourth season has been with such care and with such tenacious and meticulous planning that I think we all feel comforted by the fact that it was a perfect sendoff."</p><img alt="never have i ever l to r ramona young as eleanor wong, lee rodriguez as fabiola torres, megan suri as aneesa, maitreyi ramakrishnan as devi in episode 307 of never have i ever cr courtesy of netflix © 2022" title="never have i ever season 4 news cast release" width=2400 height=1349 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/neverhaveiever-season3-episode7-00-02-45-03r-1660507249.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Devi-Ben-Paxton love triangle will continue into Season 4.<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Never Have I Ever's central conflict has always been the classic love triangle between Devi, Ben, and Paxton. Even though season 3 sees Devi breaking things off with Paxton and having a brief romance with Des, she's still connected to the two boys throughout the season, which includes Paxton's heartfelt graduation speech on everything Devi taught him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even after that huge Ben cliffhanger, Fisher says that Paxton will still be in the picture in the final season. "The love triangle's not done," she told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/tv/never-have-i-ever-season-3-devi-paxton-ending/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=EW class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">EW</a>. "In season 4, it continues onward. But I think the part that is done is seeing him as this unattainable dream of a hunk.
