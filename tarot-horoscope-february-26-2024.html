Are you saving your money, while also still indulging in life’s little luxuries? Or are you hoarding every penny you have because you’re afraid you’re going to lose everything? Examine what is driving this mindset. Don’t allow your feelings around finances to distract you from effectively managing your wealth and setting yourself up for long-term success. You can have fun now, while still having security later. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8801261829653><h2>Taurus: 9 of Swords</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-960-×-540-px-41-1.png><p>The 9 of Swords indicates that you are suffering from some kind of loss or disappointment right now. This could have been something you saw coming, or it could have been something sudden and unexpected. Regardless, this stress has been weighing on you, possibly making you feel as though you’ll never recover from this situation. Take the time necessary to grieve and heal, keeping in mind that although what you’re going through is tremendously difficult, you can move on and grow from this experience. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Gemini: King of Wands</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-960-×-540-px-4-1.png><p>An opportunity could present itself to you this week, and the King of Wands is acknowledging that you have the strength and fortitude to accept it! Have you shied away from leadership roles in the past? Have you felt overwhelmed by taking on more responsibilities? Now is the time to stand firm in your power and own the visions you have.

Perhaps you’ve been betrayed, or it could be that you’re experiencing some sort of mental anguish. This week, this card is asking you to persevere and stay in control of your emotions so that you can move forward without falling apart. Just be sure that you don’t become permanently detached in your efforts to remain strong. If you remain in touch with your emotional side, you could come out on the other side of this situation capable of loving even more deeply. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3615160349854><h2>Virgo: Queen of Cups</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-960-×-540-px-35.png><p>The Queen of Cups indicates emotional maturity, compassion, and a nurturing spirit. This week you are being called to express this energy in some way. Perhaps a friend will approach you with relationship troubles, or it could be that a colleague is coming to you for support with a problem they’re facing. When this happens, listen from the heart as they speak, but remain emotionally separated from the issue.

By remaining focused and applying a strong work ethic, you give yourself the ability to turn your dreams into a reality. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8726968174204><h2>Scorpio: 7 of Cups</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Untitled-960-×-540-px-2.png><p>Have you felt like you’re juggling too many things at once? This week, the 7 of Cups recognizes you have many competing priorities, and while it’s noble to lend your energy to so many different things, it has proved impossible to give the right amount of attention to any one of them. As a result, one or more of those areas have suffered. Choice can be our friend, but it can also be our enemy.

The Death card is one of the more commonly misunderstood cards in the Tarot. It doesn’t represent a physical death; rather, it’s about transformation of the self and letting go of the things that are no longer serving us. What have you been holding onto that you need to let go of? Ending this chapter of your life could pave the way for something far greater down the road. This week, notice opportunities to move on from whatever it is that’s been holding you back from the future you deserve. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4114906832298><h2>Capricorn: Knight of Wands</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Untitled-960-×-540-px-12.png><p>The Knight of Wands is an impulsive card, indicating feelings of restlessness that can lead to turbulence in your life. This week, you’re being asked to look at a decision you’re facing and consider the consequences of acting in haste. You may have been ready to choose which path to take, but perhaps you should take a second look before you leap. This isn’t an easy thing to do when you’re excited about something, but this card serves as a reminder that a well-laid plan makes for long-term success. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3611111111111><h2>Aquarius: Queen of Pentacles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Untitled-960-×-540-px-25.png><p>Someone is going to need a little extra TLC this week! The Queen of Pentacles is a true provider. She’s the one who makes sure everyone is fed, the home is tidy, and that she’s giving enough time and attention to her loved ones. When she shows up in a reading, it’s a signal that someone may need more support than usual. Is someone you know struggling, or is it you who could use a shoulder to lean on? If you are feeling in over your head, don’t be afraid to seek out help. Resources are out there, and it’s OK to ask for what you need. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.93719008264463><h2>Pisces: 9 of Cups</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Untitled-960-×-540-px-28.png><p>Receiving the 9 of Cups could signal that this is the week when your stars will finally begin to align.
