You might have heard about Linux, the free and open source alternative to Windows. However, there are many other free operating systems for laptops and desktop PCs.</p><p>Capable of performing standard computer tasks, these free operating systems are strong alternatives to Windows.</p><h2 id=linux-the-best-windows-alternative>1. Linux: The Best Windows Alternative</h2><p>Linux is free, widely available, and has acres of online guidance, making it the best free OS around, and an obvious choice.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If you're looking for a free alternative to Windows, you can try any of the <a href=#>top versions of Linux</a>.</p><p>The open-source nature of Linux means that many alternative versions have been released. You’ve probably heard of Ubuntu, or its functional alternative, Linux Mint. Both are among the most popular options.</p><p>In short, Linux is the number one free alternative to Window for the simple reason that it is amazing.</p><h2 id=chromium-os>2. Chromium OS</h2><p>In some ways this is another obvious choice. Chromium OS is the operating system that Google's Chrome OS is based on and is available to download free. It's also suitable for installing on aging hardware.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Lightweight and with a focus on cloud computing, Chrome OS is one of the most well-known alternatives to Windows. Chromium OS has everything you would find on a Chromebook, making it great for web browsing, social networking, and word processing. However, it is less accomplished at media playback, and meaningful media editing is beyond its capabilities.</p><p>If you're looking for something that is easy to use, Chromium OS is a good free OS for PCs. It is available to build from source, or as a ready to install disk image from ArnoldTheBat.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download</strong>: Chromium OS (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Disk Image</a>)</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Turn Your PC or Laptop into a Chromebook</a></span></p><h2 id=freebsd-the-free-operating-system-that-isn-rsquo-t-linux>3. FreeBSD: The Free Operating System That Isn’t Linux</h2><p>Many think that FreeBSD is just another Linux distribution. While sharing the Unix-like roots of Linux, FreeBSD is the modern, open source version of the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). FreeBSD can be considered a relative of Linux and its code can be found in many places. These include Apple's macOS and Sony's PlayStation 4 operating systems.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Differences Between Linux and FreeBSD</a></span></p><p>Overall, FreeBSD is a reliable alternative operating system for servers and desktops alike. While it doesn't ship with a desktop environment by default, there is support for GNOME, KDE and Xfce desktops.</p><p>FreeBSD is of interest to those with security and privacy concerns, offering enhancements developed by the TrustedBSD project. This has the support of McAfee, DARPA, Google, University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, Apple, and many more.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeBSD</a></p><h2 id=freedos-free-disk-operating-system-based-on-ms-dos>4. FreeDOS: Free Disk Operating System Based on MS-DOS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/muo-linux-windows-operating-system-alternative-freedos.png><p>Most modern operating systems are built around the concept of multitasking. FreeDOS is different. This DOS-compatible OS is as different from Windows as it's possible to get---FreeDOS is based on Windows' predecessor, MS-DOS.</p><p>A free operating system with support for older games and applications, FreeDOS can be easily connected to your network. In addition, various software packages can be installed, from tools to enhance the classic DOS experience, to apps and games.</p><p>FreeDOS is as useful for productivity as it is for recovering old data.</p><p>It doesn't matter if you own a modern desktop, an older rig, or you're running it in a virtual machine. FreeDOS is a great option if you're looking for a more traditional experience reminiscent of 80s/90s computing.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeDOS</a></p><h2 id=illumos-a-free-os-for-pc>5. illumos, a Free OS for PC</h2><p>Another UNIX-based free Windows alternative OS, illumos is based on OpenSolaris, an operating system abandoned by Oracle in 2009. Based on BSD and System V Release 4 (SVR4), the illumos core is the heart of many OpenSolaris forks.</p><p>This is not unlike the way in which the Linux kernel is found in every Linux distribution. As a result, many illumos distributions are available. The most popular is probably OpenIndiana, which features in the accompanying video.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">illumos</a></p><h2 id=reactos-the-free-windows-clone-operating-system>6. ReactOS, The Free Windows Clone Operating System</h2><p>If talk of the alternatives being Linux and UNIX is leaving you on edge, consider ReactOS as your Windows alternative.</p><p>Originally launched in 1996 as a Windows 95 clone project, the official website states that "the ultimate goal of ReactOS is to allow you to remove Windows and install ReactOS without the end user noticing the change."</p><p>In short, the aim is that you should be able to continue using your PC as you did before. ReactOS features over 9 million lines of code and is open source.</p><p>However, ReactOS has been in the alpha stage for quite some time now. While some apps such as Adobe Reader will run on ReactOS, many won't. It's lightweight, though, requiring just 500MB of hard disk space and 96MB of RAM to run.</p><p>One day, ReactOS might be a perfect, free alternative to Windows, but until then, it is available for your evaluation. Install it from the boot CD or run the LiveCD on your existing operating system.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ReactOS</a></p><h2 id=long-running-free-os-haiku>7. Long-Running Free OS Haiku</h2><p>Haiku is free and open source and was first released in 2001. Since then, this free operating system has been in continuous development and runs various apps. Some you will have heard of, like VLC Media Player, and Quake. Haiku will also run many apps from the abandoned BeOS operating system.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If you're looking for a free alternative to Windows, it's certainly worth looking at Haiku.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Haiku</a></p><h2 id=morphos-an-alternative-os-for-old-macs>8. MorphOS: an Alternative OS for Old Macs</h2><p>MorphOS is an Amiga-like operating system, based on the 80s/90s home computer and available for PowerPC and similar devices. While the chances of an old Windows PC having a PowerPC processor are small, old Macs will run MorphOS.</p><p>However, if your Mac experience ended with Apple's adoption of x86 CPUs, a Windows alternative might be useful. Time to dig out that old iMac, Mac Mini, or Power Mac!</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MorphOS</a></p><h2 id=a-free-alternative-operating-system-aros>9. A Free Alternative Operating System: AROS</h2><p>AROS is a free operating system with a similar heritage to MorphOS but designed for x86 systems. This means that it should be able to run on your PC. In some ways, your PC or laptop turns into a modern-day Amiga computer, capable of running old and new software.</p><p>Note, however, you'll be unable to read old Amiga discs on a modern PC, even with a 3.5-inch drive. As such, you'll be limited to ROMs.</p><p>Even so, this makes for an interesting alternative to Windows. Try the Live CD version of AROS to get a good flavor of this free operating system for PCs.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AROS</a></p><h2 id=menuetos>10. MenuetOS</h2><p>Available for 32-bit and 64-bit hardware, MenuetOS is a free operating system that can be installed from a single floppy disk. Just to clarify, that's a <strong>single floppy disk of 1.4MB</strong>.</p><p>Incredibly, it includes a full GUI desktop, a browser, media player, and spreadsheet pre-installed. Built with Assembly language, MenuetOS also features support for USB webcams, and handles resolutions up to 1920x1080 (16 million colors).</p><p>Some recognizable games are also built in, along with email client, FTP, and HTTP server. No floppy drive? You can also boot MenuetOS from CD or USB.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=#>MenuetOS</a></p><h2 id=primeos-a-free-android-os-for-pc>11. PrimeOS: A Free Android OS for PC</h2><p>Google has been developing Android and Chrome OS towards a convergence of operating systems in recent years. Thanks to the addition of mouse and keyboard support, <a href=#>Android is becoming increasingly useful as a desktop operating system</a>.</p><p>And thanks to some independent developers, Android is available as a free download for 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems.</p><p>The benefits of using Android as your free Windows alternative are clear. After Windows, it is the most-used operating system on the planet. Apps for Android are everywhere, and you're probably already using at least one.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Android offers support for standard PC applications, like word processing and email/web, along with good media editing tools.</p><p>Android can also be used for media streaming and has a massive library of games. In short, Android could be the ultimate free alternative to Windows. It really depends on what you're looking for in an operating system.</p><p>Various Android versions are available for desktop and laptop PCs. PrimeOS provides an Android gaming platform on PC; you should also consider PrimeOS as a free OS for laptops.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PrimeOS</a></p><h2 id=one-of-the-oldest-alternatives-to-windows-risc-os>12. One of the Oldest Alternatives to Windows: RISC OS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/muo-linux-riscos.jpg><p>Finally, for ARM-based computers (everything from Raspberry Pi to BeagleBoard) is RISC OS.</p><p>While a little basic in some regards, RISC OS provides the user with a functional desktop experience. All the apps you need to be productive are available, from word processors to image editors. It's an unusual operating system, as different from Windows as Linux is, but worth trying if you need a free operating system.</p><p>RISC OS is developed by RISCOS Ltd and the RISC OS Open Community.</p><p>A new version of RISC OS, <a href=#>Cloverleaf</a>, is in development.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RISC OS</a></p><h2 id=which-os-is-freely-available-to-install-today>Which OS Is Freely Available to Install Today?</h2><p>All the operating systems in this article are free, easy to find, and straightforward to install alternatives to Windows.
