From there, we see Ariana Madix in tears telling the two of them–“I can’t think of two worse people. I can’t.”</span></p><p><span>In the trailer, we’re also given a glimpse of several long-awaited confrontations between cast members, including Katie Maloney confronting ex-husband Tom Schwartz about his involvement in the affair, VPR matron Lisa Vanderpump shaming the pair for sneaking around together, and a volatile confrontation between James Kennedy and Tom Sandoval.

Sandoval explained that he and Leviss first began their affair after sharing a kiss at a small after-party following the events of “Guys Night” at the Mondrian Hotel in Los Angeles; which was featured in season 10 episode 6—‘Divorce Party Crashers’.</span></p><p><span>Sandoval claims that he and Leviss had gone back to the home he shared with then-girlfriend Ariana Madix to talk; and that they spent hours talking in the backyard after getting “locked out” of the house. According to Sandoval the attraction between them was natural and the kiss totally unplanned. “We were talking, moving closer, and as we were talking, as time went on, we would just start talking closer and closer, and then all of a sudden, we’re kissing,” Sandoval says of the pair’s first encounter. “I felt something that I hadn’t felt in so long, like, emotionally.”</span></p><p><span>However, listeners and long-time fans of </span><i><span>Vanderpump Rules</span></i><span> were quick to point out that Mandel had dropped the ball in his interview with Sandoval.

The interview was so controversial that </span><i><span>Vanderpump Rules</span></i><span> producer </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Andy Cohen weighed in</span></a><span> during an episode of his SiriusXM show, </span><i><span>Andy Cohen Live</span></i><span>, saying: “I’m surprised he [Sandoval] gave an interview to someone who doesn’t seem to be familiar with the show or watched the show on any level.”</span></p><h2 id=april-5-2023-tom-schwartz-confirms-scandoval-timeline-on-watch-what-happens-live><span>April 5, 2023: Tom Schwartz Confirms #Scandoval Timeline On Watch What Happens Live</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1213010414.jpg><p><span>One month after news of the affair broke, Tom Schwartz finally sat down with Andy Cohen to explain his role in the events leading up to #Scandoval.

And Schwartz claims that Sandoval assured him that he’d handle the break-up with Madix the right way. “I’m being fed a narrative that he has broken up with Ariana or attempted to multiple times—and he’s not happy, they’re not healthy, they’re not intimate,” Schwartz said. “All of it’s inconsequential now in light of the way he handled it.”</span></p><h2 id=march-23-2023-the-season-10-vanderpump-rules-reunion-films><span>March 23, 2023: The Season 10 Vanderpump Rules Reunion Films</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NUP_201062_00461.jpg><p><span>The season-10 reunion of </span><i><span>Vanderpump Rules</span></i><span> is filmed on March 23, 2023; and it’s reported that Leviss and Shay are filming separately due to the restraining order (which was </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>dismissed just a few days later</span></a><span>).

The article detailed that Madix broke up with Sandoval earlier in the week after discovering explicit videos and intimate text messages on his phone. Tom Sandoval was seen </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>packing his belongings into his car</span></a><span> later that same evening after being kicked out of the home he shared with Madix. (The very same home where his affair with Leviss first began).</span></p><p><span>Fans were also told that producers of the show were made aware of the affair and that filming for season 10 would return to capture everything in real-time. “The majority of the cast is expected to gather and film tomorrow to share their reactions to Raquel and Sandoval’s affair.

Sources say that Madix was seen dancing around, filming the show, and cheering on Sandoval from the crowd. “She was supporting his new single,” an insider told </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>People</span></a><span>. “She had no idea any of this was happening behind her back.” It was just a few hours later that same evening that Madix discovered an intimate video recording of Leviss on her boyfriend’s phone, which prompted her to search through Leviss and Sandoval’s texting history. That’s where Madix discovered all the proof she needed of the six-month affair. Madix and Sandoval left the venue together shortly after his set ended.</span></p><p><span>That same evening, as news of the affair was coming to light, Raquel Leviss and VPR co-star Schaena Shay were in New York City for their taping of </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><i><span>Watch What Happens Live</span></i></a><span>. During the appearance, Leviss defended her decision to kiss Tom Schwartz, Katie Maloney’s ex-husband. Leviss explained that she didn’t feel she owed Maloney anything because they weren’t exactly friends. “I’m just trying to live my life and I’m sorry if that offends people but it’s not going to stop me from doing what I’m going to do,” Leviss told host Andy Cohen.</span></p><p><span>It’s then reported that after the taping, Leviss shared the truth about her affair with Tom Sandoval to fellow castmate Schena Shay. The pair then got into a verbal altercation following the admission. And Leviss claimed that Shay got physical with her, pushing her “against a brick wall” and “punching her in the face” to cause injury to her left eye. Leviss subsequently filed an order of protection against Shay regarding the alleged assault on March 9, 2023, which was </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>dismissed in late March</span></a><span> after Leviss failed to appear in court on March 29, 2023.</span></p><h2 id=january-2023-sandoval-tells-schwartz-he-s-in-love-with-raquel><span>January 2023: Sandoval Tells Schwartz He’s In Love With Raquel</span></h2><p><span>According to </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Page Six</span></a><span>, Sandoval went to Schwartz in January 2023 and admitted that he and Leviss were having an affair and that he was in love with her.

This is when things between the secret lovers really started to heat up.</span></p><p><span>The first sign of their newly found fondness for one another came during BravoCon on October 17, when Leviss wore a TomTom sweatshirt to one of the panels.

This isn’t gonna be a thing,’” she said in a confessional. “But then that first night in Cancun, he was drunk and was trying to find his room. And I heard him talking in the hallway. There was somebody working there and he was asking which direction the elevator was. I was like, ‘Wait, just come inside.’ I was like, ‘Sorry sir.’ He was really drunk. That was the second time that we were physical and intimate with each other.”</p><p>Leviss confessed to production that she and Sandoval had sex “multiple times” in Mexico, and that the affair became “a regular thing” after Shay’s wedding. “I don’t remember how often it would happen, but it definitely picked up speed more after we wrapped filming,” she said. She also revealed that she asked Sandoval to be in a throuple with Ariana. “I definitely felt really guilty,” she said. “It ate me alive not to tell her.” She continued, “I even suggested…I was like what would Ariana think about like having me as an addition. He was like, ‘No, no no. She would not be into that.’ I love Ariana as a person. And then also I’m in love with Tom Sandoval. So yeah it didn’t seem like that far-fetched of an idea. But it was not something in question. God, he’s gonna kill me. I just hate lying so much. I hate it.”</p><p>Leviss also confirmed that she and Sandoval had sex in a jacuzzi at his home with Ariana while Ariana was away for the funeral of her grandmother. “He’s asked me to not disclose all this information,” Leviss said. “Especially now with being so isolated. I feel like Tom is my one person that I do have. If I just went and betrayed him, then I’d really have nobody.” She continued, “This is the one story that we’ve agreed on getting straight. I know that the reason that Tom wanted to lie about it is because it’s a really bad look to hook up with someone’s boyfriend in their own house when they’ve gone out of town. Especially for a funeral of all things. So I don’t know. This kills my soul. I am so sick of lying. I hate it. I hate being deceitful.
