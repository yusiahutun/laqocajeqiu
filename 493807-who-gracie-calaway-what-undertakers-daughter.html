Below is a look at the top interesting facts about her that you should know about.</p><h3>1. She is a native of Austin, Texas</h3><p class=align-left>Gracie is a native of Austin, Texas. She was born on May 15 2005, making her 17 years (as of 2022). She is the daughter of Mark Calaway, The Undertaker, and his second wife, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sara Calaway</a>.

Her father is a four times WWF/E champion</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/15c695fc9756daf5.jpg><p class=align-left>Gracie’s father is a legend in the wrestling world and will forever be remembered as one of the top talents ever to grace the WWE.

He performed for WWE till his retirement in 2020.</p><p class=align-left>In WWF/WWE, Calaway was one of the top performers as The Undertaker. He is a four times WWF/E champion, three times World Heavyweight Champion, and a six times World Tag Team Champion. He was also a headliner for several top events for the organization.

Her mother debut into the wrestling world occurred in 2001</h3><p class=align-left>Gracie was born into a wrestling <a href=#>family</a> - her mother was also a <a href=#>professional wrestler.</a> Sara Calaway, born Sara Chirie Frank, developed a passion for wrestling in high school. After meeting The Undertaker, she got a chance to perform at the WWE.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/739bd1090c69099e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All about Marilyn Nault, NBA Legend Bill Russell's third wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Gracie's mother's debut into the wrestling world occurred in 2001 during the King of the Ring pay-per-view event. She was also featured in one of her husband’s storylines, where performer Diamon Dallas Page stalked, recorded, and shared videos of her with the WWE world as part of his feud with The Undertaker. The feud ended with Sara facing off against Diamon with her husband's help, a match she won.</p><p class=align-left>Sara Calaway appeared in several WWE TV specials, such as a documentary featuring her husband and a few others about WWE Divas. Furthermore, she worked as The Undertaker's valet for some time while she was married to him.</p><h3>4. Gracie Calaway's parents met at an autograph signing</h3><p class=align-left>Gracie’s parents met in 1999 at one of WWE's autograph signings.

As a show of love, The Undertaker got a tattoo of Sara's name on his throat, an experience which he admitted was pretty painful.</p><h3>5. The Undertaker and Gracie's mom are divorced</h3><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, Gracie Calaway’s parent’s marriage did not last, and the two are now divorced. Despite having a seemingly perfect relationship, the couple split up in 2007. Neither party revealed the reason for the divorce.</p><p class=align-left>It was rumoured that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mark Calaway had cheated</a> on his wife with WWE wrestler Michelle McCool. The rumours were solidified when The Undertaker and Michelle started dating soon after the divorce. The couple later got married in 2010 and have been together since.</p><p class=align-left>The Undertaker's marriage to Sara Calaway was not the first to end in divorce for the WWE superstar. Before meeting Sara, he had been married to Jodi Lynn - from 1989 to 1999.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4346c02f3e39f756.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Jamie Auld?

Gracie Calaway has a strained relationship with her father</h3><p class=align-left>The Undertaker has a great relationship with his daughter Kaia and his adopted son Kolt. However, the same cannot be said about The Undertaker and Gracie Calaway - or his relationship with his other older kids. The strained relationship was due to his career, which saw him spend much time on the road and in the WWE ring.</p><p class=align-left>In an interview, he revealed how being <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married to Michelle</a> gave him another chance to be a husband and a father. However, he has attempted to repair his relationships with his older kids, especially his son Gunner.
