But we are all humans and we naturally became close to each other as time passed by,” Han, 63, told This Week in Asia in his first sit-down interview.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">North Korean defector who swam South across river returned same way 3 years later</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The parents of some of the soldiers under Han’s command worked on the famous ginseng patches of Kaesong, and he asked them to bring some ginseng back for him when they returned from holidays at home – which he then traded to South Koreans for daily necessities, including lingerie.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At first, Han limited these illicit transactions to a few pairs that he sent home to Han Ock in Pyongyang, but he soon expanded to entire boxes of underwear.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My daughter was mesmerised by the well-designed, pretty lingerie from the South and she boasted of them to her friends. Later on, she began to sell them to her friends for a good profit,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But it did not take long before Han Ock, who was then working as a nurse at a military hospital, began to suspect she was under surveillance by the authorities in Pyongyang.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She asked her boyfriend, who was a chauffeur for an army division commander, to drive her as well as her mother and brother to the border and transport them across the Yalu River into China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Border guards waved them through, believing they were an army commander’s family, and her boyfriend returned to Pyongyang alone.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The Danish chef who spent 10 years spying on North Korea</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Han’s family travelled to the southern Chinese province of Yunnan, crossed the border to Laos and eventually reached Thailand, where they entered the South Korean embassy. But Han did not know this – when he returned home in April 2008, it was as if his family had disappeared.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was only months later that he received a phone call from Han Ock, made with the help of South Korean intelligence agents and informants, telling him that his family was alive and well in Seoul.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We all knew the South was prosperous and I also had a mind to come to the South,” Han said. “My daughter’s call was decisive in pushing me to abandon my 38 years of military life in the North and defect to the South.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He was supervising North Korean workers at a logging project in Russia when he heard from his daughter, and was soon escorted by guides hired by what he believes was a South Korean evangelist pastor all the way from Russia to Thailand via China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Han took refuge at the South Korean embassy in Bangkok. He flew from there to the South in 2009 on a chartered plane, which he shared with 29 other North Korean defectors who had also taken shelter in the embassy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After arriving at Incheon airport, he was granted a brief reunion with his family, before being debriefed by intelligence authorities for an unusually long period of seven months. He later received a reward of 300 million won (US$275,000) for handing them military secrets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This included Han divulging that the North had built six tunnels across the border to the South before 1998 for infiltration in case of a war. Three of them had already been discovered, but the other three were only found after his tip-off.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A defence ministry spokesman said no additional infiltration tunnels have since been found, although the authorities were always eager for more such information.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Will Kim Jong-un’s sister really take over North Korea if he dies?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With the remuneration, Han bought 9,000 square metres of land in the southern county of Seosan, where he settled with his family – including his daughter, who married her boyfriend in 2012, after he fled the North with his widowed mother.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Han currently works at a window panel plant in Seosan during the week, while also caring for his patches of cabbage, tobacco, corn and sesame. He also raises chickens and, with his family members, operates a plant that produces bean-based sausage casings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He once raised 30 dogs at his farm to eat, as dog meat is popular in the North and even sold as a delicacy at restaurants in Pyongyang – but his neighbours were not amused.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I didn’t know it is not allowed here to butcher a dog for consumption. I butchered one of them to share the meat with my friends and someone in the neighbourhood reported me to the authorities,” Han said, wryly. “I was consequently slapped with a 500,000 won fine for animal abuse.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">In Moon’s Korea, defectors from North face jail for propaganda fliers</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then, he has kept a discreet distance from others in the area. “That’s okay because I am too busy to mind what others think of me,” he said, proudly pointing to his greenhouses and facilities for drying tobacco leaves.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the years before former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il died in 2011, thousands of North Koreans fled the country to escape poverty. They crossed the then-porous border with China, with North Korean security guards often looking the other way in return for a fistful of dollars.</p>Things changed after <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Kim Jong-un</span></a> succeeded his father, with the new leader tightening border controls and curtailing freedom of movement – resulting in fewer defections to the South.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/12/16/f6767de8-3ec4-11eb-be63-b2d34bb06b66_1320x770_155916.jpg>The <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Covid-19 pandemic</span></a> has exacerbated this situation, reducing arrivals from North Korea to a trickle. Just 135 people reached the South in the first quarter of this year, down 41 per cent from a year earlier, and the 12 North Korean arrivals from the April to June period marked a drop of 93 per cent from the previous year – the lowest since 2003, when the relevant figures were first tallied, according to South Korea’s Unification Ministry.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The case of Han’s family is exceptional in that their defection to the South involved most of his extended family and that they successfully settled in the South, unlike many other North Koreans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many of the 33,000 North Korean defectors living in the South complain of poverty and chronic illnesses, as well as loneliness and homesickness. The latter two are often given as reasons for suicidal impulses; according to the ministry, eight North Koreans took their own lives last year.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Life after Kim: inside the schools catering to North Korean defectors</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Han’s daughter, 32-year-old Han Ock, said she had never regretted coming to the South.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was a good decision. You can make money here as much as you push yourself and you are free to choose what to do,” she said, while feeding crushed beans into a machine extruding a long strap of sausage casings. The family’s modest plant in Seosan is now equipped with 120 million won worth of machinery, including some imported from China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At one corner of the plant, Han’s two grandchildren, aged seven and three, lolled about under electronic heaters as they watched cartoons on mobile phones.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Things are different here, though, and they speak in different accents. I find it rather unpleasant that many South Koreans harbour prejudices against North Koreans living in the South,” Han Ock said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“And it costs too much to educate my daughter,” she said, adding that she had to spend large sums to send her to cram schools for mathematics and English, a must-do for many South Korean primary schoolchildren to prepare for the tough competition for a future place at a good university.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Colonel’s illicit lingerie trade and a shot at freedom</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2wuMitoJyrX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2FmgXJ%2Fj2ijoqaXmr%2BqsYysnJyqlal6tcHNp5ylq12Wu6V5wqGgnKOVo8Buus6rq6Flm6S%2Fpq3NZpuenpWYwbC%2B0marmqSV</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flingerie-secret-tunnels-and-chickens-north-korean-defectors-tale.html&text=Lingerie%2c%20secret%20tunnels%2c%20and%20chickens%3a%20a%20North%20Korean%20defectors%20tale&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flingerie-secret-tunnels-and-chickens-north-korean-defectors-tale.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flingerie-secret-tunnels-and-chickens-north-korean-defectors-tale.html&title=Lingerie%2c%20secret%20tunnels%2c%20and%20chickens%3a%20a%20North%20Korean%20defectors%20tale" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flingerie-secret-tunnels-and-chickens-north-korean-defectors-tale.html&title=Lingerie%2c%20secret%20tunnels%2c%20and%20chickens%3a%20a%20North%20Korean%20defectors%20tale" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flingerie-secret-tunnels-and-chickens-north-korean-defectors-tale.html&title=Lingerie%2c%20secret%20tunnels%2c%20and%20chickens%3a%20a%20North%20Korean%20defectors%20tale" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flingerie-secret-tunnels-and-chickens-north-korean-defectors-tale.html&description=Lingerie%2c%20secret%20tunnels%2c%20and%20chickens%3a%20a%20North%20Korean%20defectors%20tale" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./luke-bryan-confederate-flag.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Luke Bryan Weighs in on Confederate Flag">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hitscan-vs-projectile-weapons-difference-online-gaming.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hitscan vs. Projectile Weapons in Online Gaming: What's the Difference?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
