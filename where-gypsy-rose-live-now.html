After her release from prison, many people are wondering <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1689684/how-gypsy-rose-kill-mom/>where Gypsy Rose Blanchard lives now.</a></p><p><a href=# id=auto-tag_gypsy-rose-blanchard data-tag=gypsy-rose-blanchard>Gypsy Rose Blanchard</a> was born to Dee Dee Blanchard in 1995. Growing up, her mother claimed that Gypsy had a range of illnesses like leukemia and muscular dystrophy, leading to her being confined to a wheelchair and requiring constant medical attention. However, things took a turn when Gypsy Rose planned the murder of her mother with the help of her then-boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn. The motive behind the murder was Gypsy Rose’s desire for freedom and <a href=#>to escape the abuse</a> and manipulation she experienced at the hands of her mother.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/where-nicholas-Godejohn-now.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/gypsy-rose-now.png><p>“I was very sheltered” Gypsy explained to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/gypsy-rose-blanchard-released-prison-mother-murder-8347744 rel=nofollow>People</a>. “I was limited in <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1689684/how-gypsy-rose-kill-mom/>what I could watch</a> and the exposure I had to other kids. What I knew of the outside world was only in Disney movies and those don’t talk about warning signs of bad parents.”</p><p>&nbsp;In court, it was argued Gypsy was a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a rare form of abuse in which a caregiver exaggerates or induces illness in a person under their care to gain sympathy and attention. Gypsy Rose Blanchard <a href=#>pleaded guilty to second-degree murder</a> and served a 10-year prison sentence. She was released early on December 28, 2023. Godejohn, however, was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for his involvement in Dee Dee’s murder.</p><p>So where does Gypsy Rose live now after her life in prison?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-does-gypsy-rose-blanchard-live-now>Where does Gypsy Rose Blanchard live now?</h2><p>Gypsy Rose Blanchard currently lives with her husband in Louisiana. Her husband Ryan Anderson reportedly picked her up from the Chillicothe Correctional Center in Missouri around 3:30 a.m on December 29, 2023. Ahead of her release, she told People: “I know the home that I’m going home to is with my husband, and I’m going to have a really supportive family dynamic. And I think that that’s what I’ve been missing this whole time.”</p><p>On the day of her release, Gypsy Rose Blanchard posted her first selfie on Instagram. “First selfie of freedom!” she <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/C1cNGBvu7IK/>captioned</a>. She has also expanded her social media presence on TikTok where she wished her followers a<a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.tiktok.com/@gypsyroseblanchard727/video/7318915498958277934> Happy New Year </a>and saying that she’s “finally free.” The video currently has over 65 million views, as of writing this article. She’s also been spotted taking photos with fans at Burger King.</p><p>According to new legal documents obtained by TMZ, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Gypsy’s parole conditions</a> bar her from talking to&nbsp;Godejohn. She also can’t email, text, write, or communicate with him through any third-party.</p><p>On December 30, 2023, TMZ<a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.tmz.com/2023/12/30/gypsy-rose-blanchard-no-taylor-swift-meetup-chiefs-game-booted-state-missouri/> reported that authorities </a>told Gypsy Rose Blanchard and her family to not attend the Kansas City Chiefs game on New Year’s Day. Sources told the gossip site that it might be because of security risks to her continued presence in the Kansas City area where was before the game. One of her wishes post-release was to meet Taylor Swift at the Chiefs game where her boyfriend Travis Kelce plays.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>She also told People about what she reflected on in prison. “If I had another chance to redo everything, I don’t know if I would go back to when I was a child and tell my aunts and uncles that I’m not sick and mommy makes me sick, or, if I would travel back to just the point of that conversation with Nick and tell him, ‘You know what, I’m going to go tell the police everything,'” Gypsy said. “I kind of struggle with that.”</p><p>However, she’s clear about her regret over the death of her mother. “Nobody will ever hear me say I’m glad she’s dead or I’m proud of what I did. I regret it every single day,” she added.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-gypsy-rose-blanchard-s-husband>Who is Gypsy Rose Blanchard’s husband?</h2><p>Gypsy Rose Blanchard met her husband Ryan Anderson after he wrote to her after watching Tiger King and Mommy Dead and Dearest.</p><p>“We met in 2020 when the pandemic was really, really strong, and I had a lot of emotional ups and downs because of COVID,” Blanchard told People. “Unfortunately, it put the prison in a position to where it <a href=#>restricted our freedom even more</a> … So Ryan has seen me through some really good times, some really hard times.”</p><p>She added, “I would say that he is probably the most compassionate soul that I’ve ever met, and the most patient, God knows, he’s so patient with me because I could be a little bit of a lot to handle. I could be a handful, an emotional handful.”</p><p>Anderson and Blanchard obtained a marriage license in Chillicothe, Missouri, on June 27, 2022. A month later, on July 21, 2022, the two tied the knot in a small prison ceremony with no guests.</p><p>“We do plan on having a reception/redo wedding with all of our family and our friends and the dress and the cake and everything because we deserve that. I deserve that. He deserves that,” she continued to People. “Our prison wedding was just something to where we can make our vows to each other. It was something that meant something to us. And I think the party is kind of for everybody else and us, but mostly for everybody else.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gypsy-rose-blanchard-1.png><p>They do plan to have kids one day but telling them about her mother’s murder will be a challenge. “We’re in love,” says Gypsy. But also, “It’s hard because I’m going into a new life and I’m newly married, and I’m going to have kids one day, and I’m going to have to explain to my kids why their grandmother on mommy’s side isn’t around. And that’s going to be a really hard conversation.”</p><p>Gypsy Rose Blanchard is the subject of a new Lifetime documentary, The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard, which premiers on January 5, 2024. The three-night documentary event,&nbsp;The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard,&nbsp;provides Blanchard the platform to share her story, her way.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve been documenting Gypsy’s ‘coming of age’ in prison for the past seven years and over the course of this time, I watched her transform into a woman who holds responsibility for her past and now has the courage to face an unknown new free world for the first time,” said executive producer, Melissa Moore.</p><p>“After a lifetime of silence, I finally get to use my voice to share my story and speak my truth. As a survivor of relentless child abuse, this docuseries chronicles my quest for liberation and journey through self-discovery,” said Gypsy Rose Blanchard. “I am unapologetically myself and unafraid to expose the hidden parts of my life that have never been revealed until now.”</p><p>If you or someone you know is a victim of child abuse, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-Child or 1-800-422-4453, or go to <a href=# rel=nofollow>http://www.childhelp.org</a>.</p><p><strong>The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard airs on January 5, 6 and 7&nbsp;at 8pm ET/PT on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1685876/how-to-watch-lifetime/>Lifetime</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gypsy-rose-book.jpg><p>Gypsy-Rose Blanchard discovered that her whole life was a lie.
