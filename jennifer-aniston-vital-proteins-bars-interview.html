Then, the dogs go out for a walk, I feed the dogs. Make my coffee. And then, I'd check my phone. I like to not dive into this place of the electronics and everything. And you know, back in the day, we used to not have [cell] phones, right? It's so weird to try to remember what we used to do; this is a relatively new thing that we have these phones right next to our bed. So I think, for me, it's really good to sort of just wake up a little bit, have a mindful wake-up.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I did not work out today, which I usually do. But Lisa and Courteney came over last night, so we were gabbing until late. So I kind of allowed myself an extra little bit of sleep. And you have to listen to your body. You know, that's the main thing I just try to do is just always listen to your body and not punish yourself, like, "Oh, I didn't get this in. I didn't sweat today." I think that's really important.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>How did your routine change during the pandemic?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Well, everything kind of changed during the pandemic, our perspective changed. I was on such a, like, a hamster wheel of, wake up, have your coffee, get into the gym—it was just this rigorous routine, and then I'd have to get to work on time. And the pandemic, I think, allowed us to sort of take a pause that none of us have taken, and really sort of sit with ourselves and take inventory on what really is important, what matters, what doesn't really matter, and let the little things sort of slide away that don't warrant the attention that we've been giving them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And I have to say, going back to work during the pandemic was very stressful. Because as a producer of [The Morning Show] and being in that position, the health and protection of your cast and crew is number one. We were also one of the first shows to shut down. Because we were shooting our show, and this pandemic is sort of, like, happening around us, and then all of a sudden, it's right in your backyard.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We're actors, we can't social distance; we're actually wrapping ourselves around each other. And so we said, I really think it's important that we kind of shut down for a second because we're quite vulnerable, actually. Then, of course, the world shut down. But it was really hard to work under those circumstances. Because when you're actors and creatives, it's hard not to have that human connection. And that tactile connection.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was quite stressful, especially shooting Murder Mystery Two, because omicron was sort of taking over and everybody was going down, left and right. So if Adam [Sandler] or I went down, we'd shut the whole production down. So it was just about waking up every day, going, "Are you okay? Good. We've made it through another day." That's stressful. It's a lot on people.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What do you do to stay grounded when things feel out of control?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For me, meditation is big, big, big, big. To have a moment in the morning that is for yourself and to tune everything out. And whatever that meditation is for you. There's a couple apps that I abide by that I love, or just sort of do my own TM [transcendental meditation], kind of just take that 20 minutes a day to for myself, like I said, before I get into the phone or emails.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60"><strong>What can you tell me about creating your new Vital Proteins bars?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I became part of the Vital Proteins family, I was testing out all their products and loving all of them. And I'm also a real protein bar girl. I have been since I was a kid on the run, I would grab [them] back in the '90s. They weren't always the most nutritious, but they have since become, really, so much better.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So when I became part of their team, I tested out everything, and the protein bars were really big. They were just almost too much, and they were really chewy, and the flavors [were] not great. And then, I thought, Well, I make my shake in the morning and I use the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vitalproteins.com/products/chocolate-collagen-peptides data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Collagen Peptide powder" data-vars-ga-product-id=b8be3b34-d135-44df-a2cb-657d18e04980 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.vitalproteins.com/products/chocolate-collagen-peptides data-product-url=https://www.vitalproteins.com/products/chocolate-collagen-peptides data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price=$27.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=29919cf3-89f7-4213-9d56-2d56269538ad class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Collagen Peptide powder</a>, the chocolate. I was thinking … I put maca powder, goji berry, lion's mane [into my smoothie]—why can't we put all of these ingredients into a protein bar and get that nutritional value as opposed to just the collagen peptide? So we did a lot of testing and tasting until we got to these particular flavors. I love this process of creating something and perfecting it.<br></p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Vital Proteins & Jennifer Aniston Protein and Collagen Bar</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$30 at vitalproteins.com for Vital Proteins & Jennifer Aniston Protein and Collagen Bar" data-href=https://www.vitalproteins.com/products/vital-proteins-jennifer-aniston-protein-collagen-bar data-product-url=https://www.vitalproteins.com/products/vital-proteins-jennifer-aniston-protein-collagen-bar data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$30 at vitalproteins.com" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vitalproteins.com/products/vital-proteins-jennifer-aniston-protein-collagen-bar data-vars-ga-product-id=f3bced33-8d85-4eef-96ec-69aed0aebb96 data-vars-ga-product-price=$29.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=0e7fd6f1-0664-47b4-977e-66f5cf36f730 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=vital-proteins-jennifer-aniston-protein-collagen-bar data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Vital Proteins & Jennifer Aniston Protein and Collagen Bar" title="Vital Proteins & Jennifer Aniston Protein and Collagen Bar" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1655139039-bar-image-2-1655139016.jpg width=2000 height=1333 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Vital Proteins & Jennifer Aniston Protein and Collagen Bar</h2></p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Credit: Leslie Grow</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60"><strong>Well now, of course, I have to know your favorite flavor.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mine's the Coffee Cold Brew, because I love coffee.
