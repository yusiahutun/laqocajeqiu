His mother was too busy trying to fend for him and his two siblings. Thus, she was hardly at home. At the age of four, he spent his after school hours searching for vintage pieces from his neighbour's barn and junk piles. Soon after, this quickly became a hobby.</p><p class=align-left>He had a keen eye to discern trash from valuables, constantly amazing his family at what he found. It is from there that he became very good at his craft and eventually launched his own antique shop called <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Antique archaeology</a>. He would fix things with expertise making them appear as good as new then later sell them to Antique stores.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/70fdda3d03ca6774.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Fantasia's husband?

One day, Mike Wolfe woke up to the headline; Is Mike Wolfe dead or alive? Mike Wolfe's death rumours came after a businessman who goes by the same name had been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported dead</a> after suffering a heart attack. Tabloids ran with the story before he dispelled the rumour straightening out the facts.</p><h3>Mike Wolfe, family, wife, and kids</h3><p class=align-left>Since both reality stars are like two peas in a pod, the real question is; are Mike and Frank from American Pickers married? Mike was lucky enough to meet his soulmate long before his career shot up. He dated her for a whopping seventeen years on and off before they finally got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married in 2012</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Mike Wolfe's daughter Charlie Faeth Wolfe was born soon after they walked down the aisle, and to date, she is their only child together. His wife came with a son called Kyle from a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">previous relationship</a>, and since she got custody, Mike had gained a family of four.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/63a99ed75b32af00.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bryan Callen: divorce story, wife, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Dylan Dreyer salary, net worth, education, husband, and family</p><p class=align-left>Unlike most reality stars, he has a drama-free marriage and mostly lives a very private life. The only attention their marriage ever got was when people asked; does Mike Wolfe's wife have cancer? The answer at the time was yes, and many of his celebrity friends tweeted in support of the family. However, she has since undergone treatment and is now cured.</p><h3>Mike Wolfe career highlights</h3><p class=align-left>From the young <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">age of six</a>, Mike has already immersed himself in the world of collectors. He would spend all his free time traversing people's barns and dumpsites looking for vintage pieces. Many of his findings were vintage bikes, which fueled his interest in the art of biking. Mike not being one to shy away from experiences, he started racing professionally and dare to say, he was good at it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c048078f820f740f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>RegÃ©-Jean Page: ethnicity, wife, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Immediately he got his driving license; the TV star bought a van in which he would travel to faraway towns in search of anything he could sell. By that time, Mike's clientele was proliferating, and to satisfy them quickly and that's when Antique Archaeology came into being.</p><p class=align-left>He, however, still had a dream to share his story, and so he began looking for a station that would air his documentary. History Chanel had already caught wind of his populace, so they approached him with an offer to host the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">American Pickers show</a> alongside Mike Fritz. The show was an immediate smash and was recently ranked second most popular show in America after American Idol.</p><p class=align-left>Mike still felt he needed to share his story more to be able to inspire young collectors hence the birth of his first book, Kid Pickers, and American Pickers Guide to Picking. After he learned a thing or two about how TV works, he took the knowledge and made a sitcom for a partnership he had with Indian motorcycles.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e170222373123f8d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tony Hinchcliffe: Wife, gay, net worth, family, stand up comedy</span></p></a><h3>Mike Wolfe net worth salary, sources of income</h3><p class=align-left>Nobody knows Mike Wolfe's exact net worth.

Besides that, he has several businesses and mints money from the many endorsements and advertising deals he keeps featuring on.</p><h3>Houses and cars</h3><p class=align-left>Mike is a lover of nature, prompting him to look for homes in nature's deep pockets. His first house was by the Iowa River in Le Claire. He lived with his girlfriend before they finally got married and moved to a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lavish mansion</a> in the woodlands.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e48f6f1b64c743d9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Swaggy C: net worth, real name, big brother, Bayleigh, his TV</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Mike Wolfe's house lies on 32 acres of land and is estimated to be 5,100 square feet.
