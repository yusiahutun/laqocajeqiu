Five years or below. The only challenge is that different areas of the country have different climatic conditions and soils. As a result, a tree that is fast-growing in one region may grow slowly in another part.</p><h2>Fastest-growing trees in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>In modern times, tree planting has become a commercial enterprise, so softwood has replaced hardwood trees in Kenya. Below are types of trees that grow within the shortest time in the country:</p><h3>1. Acacia (Wattles/acacias)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5bd08ce9e3c938d8.jpg><p class=align-left>It is a large genus of trees and shrubs that are native to Africa and Australasia. These trees grow in different areas such as rainforests, alpine settings, grasslands, woodlands, deserts, and coastal dunes. They are among the most common <a href=#>forest</a> trees.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8327bbc4c93a0ce1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does a 5 leaf clover mean? Everything you should know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The wood is suitable for timber (construction) musical implements, weapons, and firewood. Its other uses are in tanning and fodder. The trees grow the fastest in warm climates, but they only live for about 20 to 30 years.</p><h3>2. Eucalyptus</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8327bbc4c93a0ce1.jpg><p class=align-left>Eucalyptus refers to a genus that has more than 700 species of flowering trees and shrubs. Their barks can range from fibrous, smooth, and hard to stringy. The leaves have oil glands, and their sepals and petals are fused to form a cap over the stamens. It has a woody capsule fruit that is usually called a gum nut.</p><p class=align-left>Most eucalyptus trees originated from Australia but are now grown all over the <a href=#>world</a> in plantations. Their timber is precious, but the tree can be used for many other things. For example, it is used in essential oils, pulpwood, and honey production.</p><h3>3. African cypress (Widdringtonia)</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4be81c06f90c7aa2.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of flowers that are native to Africa with pictures</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/060ac530a34d0614.png><p class=align-left>The African cypress is a genus of<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> coniferous trees</a> that belong to the cypress family. There are four species of these trees, and they all originated from <a href=#>South Africa</a>. They can grow up to a height of 20 meters. Its leaves are evergreen and appear scale-like while the seedlings are needle-like.</p><p class=align-left>Wood from African cypress is soft, light, and aromatic. It is easy to split it, and the good thing about it is that it resists decay. It is used in various areas, including in making furniture, outdoor and indoor panelling, fencing posts, and firewood.</p><p class=align-left>It is common to find these trees grown as live fences in Kenya. They are planted closely together and trimmed at the same height to form a neat uniform fence. It can also be grown at the edges of farmlands with minimum interference on other crops.</p><h3>4. Pine</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/aa3df72b4f2451bc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Which are 10 most expensive woods in the world?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4be81c06f90c7aa2.png><p class=align-left>Pine trees grow relatively fast as they can go to at least two feet to three feet per year. Pine is a conifer belonging to Pinaceae of the genus Pinus and is traced to the Indo-European base. The species is one of the most common trees used as lumber.</p><p class=align-left>Pines are evergreen regardless of climatic conditions. They are also coniferous resinous, meaning they produce resin, a highly viscous substance that can be converted into polymers. The tree can grow up to a height of about 80 meters, but most of its species reach between 15 and 45 m tall.</p><p class=align-left>One of the advantages of pines is that they are long-lived and can reach ages of between 100 and 1000 years or even longer. The 'Methuselah' pine, for instance, is about 4,600 years old and is believed to be one of the oldest living organisms.</p><p class=align-left>Branches, needles, and cone scales of pine trees grow spirally and are usually arranged in Fibonacci number ratios. Its bark is primarily thick and scaly, but other species have thin and flaky barks. It can survive in a variety of environments, such as rainforests and semi-arid deserts.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ae6be87726796b1a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 most dangerous jungles in the world</span></p></a><h3>5. Bamboo</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/70a7f8f944863501.png><p class=align-left>Bamboos happen to be among the fastest-growing plants globally because they are dependent on a unique <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rhizome system</a>. The term bamboo refers to a diverse group of evergreen plants that flower perennially. They belong to the sub<a href=#>family</a> Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae.</p><p class=align-left>Like other grasses, the intermodal regions of bamboo are hollow, and then the vascular bundles in the cross-section are distributed throughout the stem. The flowering plant does not have dicotyledonous woody xylem. As a result, giant bamboos are usually columnar as opposed to tapering.</p><p class=align-left>Some bamboo species can grow by 910 mm in a day which is 1mm for every 90 seconds. Since they can grow rapidly even in marginal lands, they are a prime candidate for afforestation and carbon sequestration and other climate change mitigation strategies.</p><p class=align-left>Bamboo is widely used in Kenya for construction, especially in the hospitality and tourism industry. However, they also have an array of other uses, such as fencing, <a href=#>music</a> instruments, and toothpicks. In addition, soft bamboo shoots, leaves, and stems can be used as food for mountain gorillas, chimpanzees, and gorillas.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8a286f615cead63c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dania farming in Kenya: How to grow coriander and profit per acre</span></p></a><h3>6. Moringa Oleifera</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/aa3df72b4f2451bc.jpg><p class=align-left>Moringa oleifera is not only fast-growing but also a drought-resistant tree belonging to the family Moringaceae. The plant is native to the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Indian subcontinent</a>. It is also referred to as the drumstick tree, horseradish tree, or ben oil tree. The deciduous species can grow to a height of 10 to 12 meters with a trunk diameter of about 45 cm.</p><p class=align-left>This tree is commonly grown for its young seed pods and leaves, serving as vegetables and traditional herbal medicine. It is also used in the process of water purification. Even though it is considered an invasive species, it has not been observed to invade intact habitats and does not displace native flora.</p><p class=align-left>It starts to flower within the first six months of planting. It blooms twice annually or all year-round depending on the climate. Those who cultivate it must cut it back annually to about 1 to 2 meters to regrow and produce pods and leaves that are easy to reach.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1e57bb666451cb08.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 15 cleanest cities in Africa</span></p></a><h3>7. Jacaranda</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e7a445ec8e229f97.jpg><p class=align-left>Jacaranda is one of the most common tree species in Kenya partly due to its landscaping benefits. The tree is thought to have originated from South America and then spread across the world, Kenya included. What makes it a good landscaping tree is its closely clustered light lavender-blue or purple leaves.</p><p class=align-left>It is planted in homesteads not only for aesthetics but also because it has a good shade. In addition, some people grow the tree for its medicinal benefits. The tree is versatile and can be grown in highlands, grasslands,<a href=#> river</a> banks or even swampy areas.</p><p class=align-left>The tree is categorized as an invasive species because it forms a thicket of seedlings at its base. These seedlings, if let to grow, end up displacing other plants around them. They, therefore, demand a lot of attention in weeding to control their growth. The best way to grow them is through cuttings grafted from seedlings, as they take only three years to mature.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2e05d8ddd6fb0236.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 richest Twitch streamers in 2021 and their net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The list of the fastest-growing trees in Kenya is long and diverse. Such trees grow in coastal areas, <a href=#>western</a> highlands, and even northern and eastern semi-arid regions. There is also a demand for fast-growing shade trees in Kenya as they are planted in homesteads.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke </a>shared an article about the list of <a href=#>flowers that are native to Africa</a> with pictures. Africa is the second-largest continent on the planet and is home to millions of plant species. Most of the vegetation cover grows wildly and are yet to be studied. This is the case for the African flowering plants, most of which grow in forested and remote areas.</p><p class=align-left>There is no shortage when it comes to flowers that are native to Africa. Most of these diverse plants have been introduced to other parts of the world, but still, there are many flowers unique to Africa waiting to be discovered.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/48af6c479fcca988.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best courses for B+, B, or B- students in 2024 (KUCCPS)</span></p></a><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FkG1sb25dbHqnrdKtnKysXZy%2FsMPIp55mrKKasrR5yKdkpJ2erq5vtNOmow%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f314566-7-fastest-growing-trees-in-kenya-html.html&text=Top%207%20fastest-growing%20trees%20in%20Kenya%3a%20Full%20list%20with%20pictures&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f314566-7-fastest-growing-trees-in-kenya-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f314566-7-fastest-growing-trees-in-kenya-html.html&title=Top%207%20fastest-growing%20trees%20in%20Kenya%3a%20Full%20list%20with%20pictures" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f314566-7-fastest-growing-trees-in-kenya-html.html&title=Top%207%20fastest-growing%20trees%20in%20Kenya%3a%20Full%20list%20with%20pictures" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f314566-7-fastest-growing-trees-in-kenya-html.html&title=Top%207%20fastest-growing%20trees%20in%20Kenya%3a%20Full%20list%20with%20pictures" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f314566-7-fastest-growing-trees-in-kenya-html.html&description=Top%207%20fastest-growing%20trees%20in%20Kenya%3a%20Full%20list%20with%20pictures" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./11-whipped-cream-nutrition-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="11 Whipped Cream Nutrition Facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./307286-richest-rappers-world-according-forbes-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top 30 richest rappers in the world and their net worth in 2022">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
