Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson’s families were awarded the substantial amount of money after the civil suit found Simpson responsible in the wrongful death case.</p><p>The accused killer had been <a href=#>acquitted of the murder</a> charges years before.</p><p>He specifically said he didn’t want Fred Goldman to receive anything – “zero, nothing”, he said.</p><p>LaVergne explains he was emotional after OJ Simpson’s death, with the lawyer hitting out without thinking over what he said.</p><p>“Within an hour of knowing that OJ died, he started talking s**t,” LaVergne claims his words were towards Goldman’s attorneys.</p><p>“My advocate instinct was, ‘Oh, you’re gonna keep shitting on him even after he’s dead?’”</p><p>“’Fine, you know? You get nothing.’ And so, those were my remarks then. But I backtracked, and they were pretty harsh remarks. And now I’m going in the other direction.”</p><p>He has now clarified the claim will be accepted and handled in accordance with Nevada law, as it should be.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-oj-thought-he-d-get-better>OJ thought ‘he’d get better’</h2><p>It comes after OJ’s friend said Simpson thought he’d be able to fight the prostate cancer and regain his health.</p><p>Bruce Fromong, his longtime friend, said he was called up by the NFL Hall of Famer 10 days before he died to cancel an event. He was meant to do a signing for PSA-JSA memorabilia company, but had to back out.</p><p>Fromong suggested rescheduling for a later time, but OJ told him to hold off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0>“‘Nah, I just give me a little bit of time. Let me get to feeling better,’” the celebrity reportedly said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0>“I went, ‘Huh, it’s so bad you can’t…'” says Fromong. “Because he enjoyed getting around the guys and signing,” adding, “That meant he was really not feeling well.”</p><p>He added OJ didn’t tell many people about his diagnosis, but had known himself for about a year. But he thought the athlete had beaten it.</p><p>“We thought he was getting better, and he was not”.</p><p>The prosecuting lawyer, who tried to convict OJ Simpson for double-murder in the famous criminal trial of the century, <a href=#>only had eight words to say after his death</a>.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2aEcLvJZqqipaCovK%2B%2FjKWYsLGVp3q1rcqeqmaakZi4brTAq6qhZZOkuq6xza2qZpmWqbKzecCtn6WdpJrAbrDEmquhZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2foj-simpsons-lawyer-takes-back-harsh-comments-after-athletes-death.html&text=OJ%20Simpson%27s%20lawyer%20takes%20back%20harsh%20comments%20after%20athlete%27s%20death&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2foj-simpsons-lawyer-takes-back-harsh-comments-after-athletes-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2foj-simpsons-lawyer-takes-back-harsh-comments-after-athletes-death.html&title=OJ%20Simpson%27s%20lawyer%20takes%20back%20harsh%20comments%20after%20athlete%27s%20death" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2foj-simpsons-lawyer-takes-back-harsh-comments-after-athletes-death.html&title=OJ%20Simpson%27s%20lawyer%20takes%20back%20harsh%20comments%20after%20athlete%27s%20death" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2foj-simpsons-lawyer-takes-back-harsh-comments-after-athletes-death.html&title=OJ%20Simpson%27s%20lawyer%20takes%20back%20harsh%20comments%20after%20athlete%27s%20death" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2foj-simpsons-lawyer-takes-back-harsh-comments-after-athletes-death.html&description=OJ%20Simpson%27s%20lawyer%20takes%20back%20harsh%20comments%20after%20athlete%27s%20death" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-newsroom-atlas-shrugged-patrick-fabian-welcomes-daughter-delilah-grace.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Patrick Fabian Welcomes Daughter Delilah Grace">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./article-dd665aa0-2e08-11ed-8891-038176ccbfee-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="N.
