A growing number of the nearly <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">800 Confederate statues and monuments</a> in the US have been removed, alongside a <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">few toppled</a> or <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">defaced</a> homages to <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">founding fathers</a> who profited from slavery.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Brands such as <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Aunt Jemima</a>, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Uncle Ben’s </a>and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Cream of Wheat</a> are reconsidering the racial stereotypes emblazoned on their packaging.

But last year, the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, announced that the unveiling<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> had been delayed</a>. He has since said the new version won’t be released <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">for another decade</a> and may <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">not even feature Tubman</a>.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Maybe every single time you pay for something, you’re not thinking, ‘oh goodie, there’s Andrew Jackson, my hero.’ But in a way, that’s kind of the point, right?”<strong> </strong>said <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Alvita Akiboh</a>, an assistant professor of history at the University of Michigan.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>When Akiboh taught in Chicago, her students assumed that <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">the local park</a> in a majority Black and Latino neighborhood was named for Frederick Douglass, the famed abolitionist. It was instead a salute to <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Stephen A Douglas</a>, an Illinois senator <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">whose political machinations enabled slavery</a>, and who is quoted saying: “<a href=# data-link-name="in body link">I am in favor of confining citizenship to white men</a>.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Similar tributes to a checkered past exist all over the US, from streets <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">named for Confederate officers</a> and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">slave traders</a> to congested highways originally designed to reinforce segregation and eliminate Black <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">neighborhoods</a>. When sports fans attend baseball or football games, they turn to the American flag and sing a<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> national anthem</a> penned by Francis Scott Key, a slave owner who abused his authority as district attorney to persecute Black men and abolitionists.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“I hope at least that the questioning that has started with monuments, because they’re visible, because they’re large, and because they’re easy to remove, will continue to happen as we start to re-evaluate the symbols on money, on our stamps,” Akiboh said. “The flags and other symbols that we use. The songs that we sing for our patriotic anthems. And that definitely, we will get to re-evaluate our K-12 curriculum.”</p><figure id=b6c9854f-71c9-4f9b-a62a-7f3a9551df80 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>A statue of the Confederate general Albert Pike after it was toppled and defaced near Judiciary Square the previous night following a day of Juneteenth celebrations in Washington DC on 20 June.</span> Photograph: Samuel Corum/EPA</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The attorney general, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">William Barr</a>, recently came under fire when he casually quipped that “<a href=# data-link-name="in body link">history is written by the winners</a>”. For centuries, white Americans have always had the position and privilege to shape the country’s historical record.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“The American story has been a story of progress, of triumph, of victory, right? Of liberty and freedom,” said <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Daina Ramey Berry</a>, Radkey professor of history at the University of Texas. But “enslaved people don’t fit well into that narrative”. nor do other racial minorities who have suffered because of the American experiment.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“That is the story of America, to have Trayvon Martin and Barack Obama simultaneously. To have Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln and 4 million people enslaved simultaneously. That paradox is the American narrative,” said <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Rhae Lynn Barnes</a>, an assistant professor in Princeton University’s history department.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Aspirational depictions of a city upon a hill and liberty and justice for all lose their luster when they’re juxtaposed against the systematic genocide of indigenous peoples, or an intricate slave-based economy rubber-stamped by revolutionaries fighting for their own freedom. But more dated history textbooks rarely provide that level of insight around how minority communities were treated during the country’s early years, and slavery gets all but erased – “there’s no discussion of what life was like in the United States prior to 1860, or if it is, it’s just African Americans were enslaved in this country, and the civil war freed them,” said Berry.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>It’s this inconsistent retelling that has allowed for the veneration of deeply flawed characters, whose biographies are often cherry-picked for effect. Many of the founding fathers, including <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">George Washington</a> and Thomas Jefferson, were slaveholders, despite <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">waxing poetic</a> about how the institution was a “<a href=# data-link-name="in body link">moral depravity</a>”. Even <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Benjamin Franklin</a>, revered as an <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">early abolitionist</a>, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">owned</a> enslaved people <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">for much of his life</a> and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">ran ads selling others</a> in his newspaper.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Champions of these men often attribute their moral failings to the sociopolitical environment in which they lived. But “just because slavery was accepted among white elites or even the broader white population at the time does not mean it was accepted by everybody, because everybody includes Black people who were enslaved, indigenous people who were pushed off their lands in order to expand plantation slavery,” said Akiboh.</p><figure id=6d29b99a-1c74-4352-83a9-b3da7ca10fb1 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Lawmakers in Mississippi voted on June 28 to remove the Confederate battle standard from the state flag, after nationwide protests drew renewed attention to symbols of the United States’ racist past.</span> Photograph: Rory Doyle/AFP/Getty Images</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>A different logic has been used to justify the Confederate shrines that commemorate men who committed treason in an effort to uphold slavery. Defenders, including Donald Trump, decry “the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">history and culture </a>of our great country being ripped apart”. But the monuments they are trying to protect aren’t usually civil war artifacts; they were instead erected decades after the conflict ended, as “a reminder for Black and brown people to remember their place”, said Akiboh.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Meanwhile, book publishers, songwriters, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Madison Avenue advertisers </a>and Hollywood studios <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">immortalized</a> the racist caricatures and racial stereotypes such as Aunt Jemima that have recently fallen under scrutiny, said<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> Karen Cox</a>, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Even <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Mickey Mouse</a>, a beloved American staple, rose to prominence in 1928 with a tune from blackface minstrelsy, Barnes said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“The racism and white supremacy is our national sin,” said Cox. “It doesn’t belong to the south.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Much like currency, larger objects and icons have often been resistant to change, despite public repudiation of them; as recently as last year, more than 1,700 publicly sponsored symbols of the Confederacy still appeared everywhere from Maine to Washington state, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">according to a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center</a>. Almost any relic’s retirement seems to get blowback from subgroups of Americans, for reasons ranging from historical preservation to outright bigotry.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“It’s all about shoving this down people’s throats and erasing the history of the white people, and I think that’s wrong,” Virginia state senator Amanda Chase recently exclaimed <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">in a video</a>.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>When earlier this month <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Nascar</a> hosted the first major sporting event with fans since the coronavirus pandemic, a plane with a gargantuan Confederate battle flag flew across the skyline to protest against the new ban. Far from an isolated incident, overt tributes to the Confederacy and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">acts of racial terror</a> are still common in the US.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1><a href=# data-link-name="in body link">At least 34</a> Confederate monuments <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">have been dedicated</a> since 2000.
