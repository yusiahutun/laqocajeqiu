So let’s dive into this article and learn more about him.</p><p>Slash is a British-American musician and the former lead guitarist of Guns N’ Roses, a hard rock band. With the band, he earned worldwide popularity and renown. All the band members earned international fame in the late&nbsp;1980s and early 1990s. Slash acquired an early interest in music and began playing the guitar as a teenager.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvstarsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/slash-116.jpg><p>He had a tough upbringing because his parents divorced when he was young, and he was raised mainly by his father, with whom he had a strained relationship. His parents ultimately reconciled and then divorced, adding to his emotional pain. As a result, Slash grew up to be a rebellious adolescent who was resentful of his upbringing.</p><p>The legendary guitarist despised school but was captivated by the music and was encouraged to pursue music as a career by a teacher. He attempted to create a band with a buddy when he was a teenager, and while the band did not form, the experience aided in his growth as a guitarist. In the mid-1980s, he joined the band Guns N’ Roses and became their main guitarist, achieving international acclaim.</p><p>He eventually left the band to join the Slash’s Snakepit and&nbsp;Velvet Revolver&nbsp;supergroup and then pursued a solo career. Slash is regarded as one of the finest guitarists in history and has earned critical praise.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Slash_Quick_Facts></span><strong>Slash: Quick Facts</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table><tbody><tr><td width=366><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td width=385>Saul Hudson</td></tr><tr><td width=366><strong>NickName</strong></td><td width=385>Slash</td></tr><tr><td width=366><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td width=385>July 23, 1965</td></tr><tr><td width=366><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td width=385>Hampstead, London</td></tr><tr><td width=366><strong>Age</strong></td><td width=385>55 years old</td></tr><tr><td width=366><strong>Sun Sign</strong></td><td width=385>Leo</td></tr><tr><td width=366><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td width=385>Anthony Hudson</td></tr><tr><td width=366><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td width=385>Ola J.
