For example, she was a regular model in the London Fashion Week for many years before moving to screens.</p><h3>As an actress</h3><p class=align-left>Even though modelling made her famous in London and the USA, acting made her famous in India and Asia. The movies that have had the most impact on her brand since 2003 include:</p><h4>Boom (2003)</h4><p class=align-left><i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Boom</a>, </i>written and directed by Kaizad Gustad, was her first-ever movie. She worked with some of the biggest names in Bollywood, such as Amitabh Bachchan and Jackie Shroff.

In the past five years, she has collaborated with major NGOs in improving the lives of Indians, primarily through <a href=#>education</a> and medical care.
