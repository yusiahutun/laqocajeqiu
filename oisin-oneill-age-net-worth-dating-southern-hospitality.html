How old is he? How much is his net worth? Is he dating anyone?</p><p>Read all about it as you scroll down.</p><h3><strong>Oisin O’Neill On Southern Hospitality</strong></h3><p>Oisin O’Neill has joined Southern Hospitality as a new VIP server which premiered on 7 December 2023 in season 2. He is from Wicklow, Ireland, but he recently moved to Charleston, according to his official Bravo bio. Oisin lived in Tulum, Mexico, before moving to The Holy City, where he met Maddi and Grace and became friends.</p><p>Regarding Oisin’s career, he was a professional rugby player before deciding to pursue his aspirations of having an “international career in nightlife.”</p><p>With the assistance of his close buddy Maddi, the new VIP waiter was able to secure a position at Republic Garden & Lounge, Leva’s nightclub. As teased in his cast bio, “New to this eclectic team, Oisin navigates tricky waters when his flirtatious nature is met with mixed reviews from his co-workers and their boyfriends.”</p><p>At a Bravo event at Republic in Charleston, South Carolina in November, he told The Messenger, “I stay away from drama at all costs.”</p><p class=custom-paragraph>“In all honesty, I think drama follows me,” he said. “I like to stir the pot a little bit or poke the bear, but it’s all just bantering, you know what I mean? And I love people’s reactions, so yeah, maybe I do stir up a little drama. Unintentionally, but it just all comes my way.”</p><p>Even though Emmy Sharrett is in a committed relationship with Will Kulp, it’s evident from the Season 2 teaser that Oisin’s arrival will cause some rifts in the Republic crew because he has a thing for her.</p><p>A few of his castmates had a few things to share about Oisin. “You kind of see Oisin coming from a mile away,” Emmy told The Messenger. “He’s not a very calm, sly person. He’s kind of obnoxious.”</p><p>“Yeah, Oisin certainly isn’t subtle, and you can see that from the trailer,” Will shared. “I think the thing that people are gonna be able to see is how Oisin tests our relationship and then how that tests our friendships with others, because he definitely tries to insert himself between Emmy and me. And then that has a ripple effect amongst the friend group that is interesting to see play out.”</p><p>Oisin is determined to have fun in the show as well. “I mean, I have a flirtatious nature by trade. I think I was just born out of the womb like that, and I think that it rubs some people off the wrong way – and others, they like to be rubbed that way,” he told PopCulture. “So I think you’ll get to see a little bit more about where that all goes. I’m definitely here to break some hearts and spill some milk.”</p><p>However, his magic of confidence didn’t work in all the females on the show and one of them is Emmy Sharrett. Concerning Kulp, who is the target of several of O’Neill’s provocative remarks this season, he told PopCulture that things went “rather interestingly” between the rookie and him.</p><p>“I think you get to see us really butt heads. It’s not a casual interaction. He’s really coming for me and I put my foot down and it all plays out rather interestingly,” Will hinted. “I think it’s going to be really fun to watch the evolution of me and Oisin’s relationship because it starts one way and then it becomes something else and then it becomes another thing entirely by the end of the season.”</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Oisin O’Neill Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Oisin O’Neill, as of 2023, has amassed a net worth of under $500K.
