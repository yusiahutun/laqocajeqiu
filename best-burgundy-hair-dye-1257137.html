Here's our user guide for a comprehensive approach to selecting a burgundy hair dye.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Pick the Best Burgundy Hair Dye— an Extensive User Guide</h2></p><p>Searching for the best burgundy hair dyes is as easy as eating a piece of cake if you keep a few factors in mind. Consider these points before you are up to fill your shopping cart.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ingredients&nbsp;</strong></p><p>First and foremost, it's better to begin your shopping journey by checking the ingredient list. Some no-no ingredients like PPD, ammonia, parabens, sulfates, and alcohol must avoided as they may irritate the scalp and dry out the natural moisture, leading to itching and flakiness. Instead, it's good to try natural and organic burgundy color hair dye formulas containing gentle ingredients like essential oils, plant-based extracts, ethically sourced protein, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Skin Undertone&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Burgundy has an array of shades; hence, it's crucial to know which shade would compliment your skin undertone to improve the overall appearance. Typically, skin undertones are classified into three— cool, warm, and neutral. Cool undertones have hues of pink, blue, and red. For this undertone, burgundy hair color dyes with blue and purple hints work well. Warm skin tones have yellow, peach, and golden hues, and hair colors containing red, orange, and yellow hints perfectly match with them. Further, neutral undertones are a balanced hue of warm and cool tones, for instance, a blend of yellow and blue hues. Hence, folks with neutral undertones get the freedom to try any shade of burgundy falling to the spectrum.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Existing Hair Condition&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Determining your current hair condition will help you understand if your hair is prepared for the dyeing process. Before dyeing hair, you can make a few changes in your haircare routine to repair existing hair damage for better color absorption. Avoid using any styling hair products, such as gels, shampoos, and conditioners before direct application. Also, limit the use of heat styling tools to let your hair condition and restore its strength naturally.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Color Longevity&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The longevity of your burgundy color dye depends on the type of hair color you use. For instance, permanent hair color usually has a longer color stay time than semi-permanent and demi-permanent formulas. The best burgundy permanent hair dye<strong> </strong>colors may last up to 8 to 12 weeks. Demi-permanent colors may last 12 to 24 washes, while semi-permanent hair dyes last from 10 to 12 washes. However, the duration is subject to factors like hair type, length, and porosity; hence, it varies from individual to individual. If you wish to have a long-lasting color, permanent options will do the job. Further, semi-permanent and demi-permanent burgundy hair color dye options are best if you like changing hair color frequently.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ease of Application&nbsp;</strong></p><p>While dyeing hair, pick a good burgundy hair dye that is simple to apply and avoids mess especially if you are doing this at home. Following the instructions is a great move to ensure better application.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer Reviews&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Last but not least, checking user reviews will let you understand more about the product and its properties. You may want to know how the hair product works, what other people say about it, or how was their experience. This will allow you to make analyzed and more calculative decisions.&nbsp;<br>After finding your best match for burgundy hair dye, learn the right way of using it to fetch maximum results. For this, check out the application steps given below.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Apply the Best Burgundy Hair Dye?</h2></p><p>Applying a burgundy hair dye becomes easy with the given steps. Follow them to use a hair dye correctly.&nbsp;</p><li>Wear the gloves and pour the developer into a container.&nbsp;</li><li>Mix the developer and bleach in a ratio of 2:1. You may prefer bleaching your hair if you have dark hair and want a bright burgundy. Also, some formulas may have pre-added bleaching ingredients; hence, there’s no need to use a bleach product separately.&nbsp;</li><li>Apply the mixture to your hair and leave it for 15 to 20 minutes until it lightens hair to the desired color intensity, maybe from black to brown tone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Wash the formula and follow with natural air dry. Plus, you may take a day off to apply the color.&nbsp;</li><li>Read the instructions on the burgundy hair box dye and apply it on the strands.&nbsp;</li><li>Let it set for the required time as per the instructions.&nbsp;</li><li>Wash the formula with a gentle cleanser and follow with a conditioner to enhance the effects.&nbsp;</li><p><br>It's crucial to follow a proper haircare regime after applying a burgundy hair dye<strong> </strong>to maintain the color vibrancy and longevity. Below are some tips you can follow for the same.</p><p><h2 class=title>Tips to Maintain Burgundy Hair Color</h2></p><p>Keeping your hair color fresh and radiant is no more a task when you upgrade your haircare routine. Here are some tips that will extend your hair color's life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Use Gentle Shampoos&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Applying gentle shampoos free from harsh chemicals, especially sulfates, never strips off the color. Sulftae-free cleansers are mild on the scalp and hair and remove the buildup while restoring the color.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Avoid Hot Water&nbsp;</strong></p><p>While showering, ensure the water isn't too hot, as this can make hair prone to damage. The heat can open and inflame the cuticles, leading the color molecules to drain easily. This can fade color, making hair dull and lifeless. Hence, it's a good idea to use normal water.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Apply a Deep Conditioner&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A deep conditioner can infuse the required amount of moisture in your hair to keep it healthy. Further, it can increase the overall color vibrance to keep your tresses looking shiny and lifted. Also, applying a hair mask once a week sounds like a good approach to prolong the hair color.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Avoid Overuse of Heat Styling Tools&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As a general rule of thumb, it's crucial to follow the right process for using heat styling tools to minimize the risk of damage. Before you glide on your favorite straighter or give your hair an intense warm blowout, prepare your strands with a primer. This will detangle hair while creating a protective covering to resist heat damage. Also, avoid using your heat styling tools too frequently to prevent hair brittleness and breakage.&nbsp;</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Burgundy hair is the latest trendsetter in the world of hair care, and the best burgundy hair dye options provide impressive coloring results. These instantly make hair full of life that never goes unnoticed. So try these burgundy color dyes and get ready for the fashion runway. You may try a few cult-classic formulas like Garnier Nutrisse Nourishing Creme Hair Color, Adore Semi Permanent Hair Color, etc., to turn yourself into a confident burgundy hairdo, all prepared to spread the aura.</p><h2 class=title>FAQ's</h2><p>Should I bleach my hair before using a burgundy hair dye?</p><p>Most burgundy shades leave color on dark hair while eliminating the need for bleaching. However, if you want a bright burgundy hair dye with shades near pink or red, you may bleach hair to lighten dark hair color.</p><p>Can I use burgundy color on naturally black hair?</p><p>Using burgundy directly on black hair may not provide the desired results. It may turn black to dark brown but not into an ideal burgundy shade. Nevertheless, bleaching your hair to a shade of brown and then applying a burgundy dye provide improved results.</p><p>Can I apply other hair colors on burgundy hair?</p><p>Just like shades of brown and black, you may have to bleach or lighten natural hair color if you wish to transform the shade. To lighten your burgundy hair color, bleaching products like baking soda and color removal formulas are worth a try.</p><p>Do burgundy hair dyes cover grays?</p><p>Various shades of burgundy, especially hues of red, cover grays for a natural-like look. You may consider trying complimentary shades at home that match your skin tone.</p><h2 class=title>Why Trust Pinkvilla</h2><p>Our haircare expert, Alvira, likes experimenting with various hair colors that result in flawless tresses.
