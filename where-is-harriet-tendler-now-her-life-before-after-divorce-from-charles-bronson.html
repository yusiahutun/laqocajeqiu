She grew up in a Jewish family in Philadelphia, USA. Harriet is also Caucasian and American by nationality.</p><p>As for her parents, her father was a prosperous Jewish dairy farmer. However, she did not reveal his name or the identity of her mother. As her father was referred to as a “widowed farmer”, it is clear that her mother died at an early age.</p><p>As a teenager, Harriet enrolled in 1947 at the Bessie W. Hicks School of Stage, Screen, and Radio in her hometown of Philadelphia. There, she met the love of her life, Charles Bronson. Want to know more about their relationship? Scroll down!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>Harriet Tendler And Her Ex-Husband Charles Buchinsky’s Decade-Long Marriage; How Did She First Meet Him?</b></h2><p>Harriet was just 18 when she met her ex-husband of 26 years, Charles Bronson. His real name at the time was Charles Dennis Buczynski, which he later changed to Bronson. As mentioned above, the two met at school, where Buchinsky was eight grades older than her. They both wanted to pursue acting careers.</p><p>After dating for some time, the former couple decided to tie the knot. Nevertheless, Harriet’s father was not very happy with their relationship, as Buczynski was Catholic and they were Jewish. In addition, the then fiancé did not have a good source of income as he was working in a coal mine at the time. In fact, at the time of their first date, he had only four cents in his pocket.</p><p>However, Harriet and her ex-fiancé managed to get her father to agree. Tendler and her then-boyfriend Bronson finally walked down the aisle on 30 September 1949 in Atlantic City, New Jersey. She supported him through difficult times, and they were together for more than a decade. However, in 1965 the couple separated.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>Harriet Tendler Had Two Children With Her Spouse</b></h2><p>Although the couple parted ways, Harriet and her partner Charles had two beautiful children during their marriage. After their marriage, the former couple finally welcomed their first child on 27 February 1955 and named her Suzanne Bronson. After a break of six years, in February 1961, their son Tony Bronson was born again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Harriet-tendler-Daughter.jpg><p>Tendler brought up the children alone, as her husband was absent most of the time for work. She stayed at home and took care of the children while her former partner made his way to Hollywood.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>Reason Behind The Divorce Of Harriet And Charles Bronson</b></h2><p>Harriet did her best to support her husband during a difficult period in his life and raised their children alone. Bronson, on the other hand, had an affair with his younger counterpart, the actress Jill Ireland</p><p>He became one of the most successful actors in Hollywood, with his wife keeping him at bay, but it was Jill who eventually came between them. However, according to Harriet, the reason for their divorce was not his affair with the actress, but the way her husband coped with fame.</p><p>Moreover, the celebrity’s wife even said in an interview with WAMG that Charles was only in the business for the money. So he didn’t care to watch her work, but he was always fascinated by what was next.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>Did Harriet Tendler Remarry After Her Divorce?</b></h2><p>No, there is no information that she was romantically involved with anyone after her divorce. She is busy and happy in her own business and does not feel the need for another partner.</p><p>Meanwhile, her ex-husband married his counterpart, actress Jill Yollander, with whom he was having an affair. They married on 5 October 1968 and had one biological daughter, Zuleikha Bronson. Sadly, she died on 18 May 1990 of breast cancer at their home in Malibu, California, at the age of 54.</p><p>Charles Bronson remarried for the third time, at the age of 70, in December 1998 to Kim Weeks. The couple was together for five years until his death.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>Harriet’s Former Husband Charles Bronson’s Death</b></h2><p>Although his health deteriorated day by day in the following days, Charles Bronson also underwent hip surgery in August 1998. He then decided to retire from acting.</p><p>Reports gave pneumonia and Alzheimer’s disease as the cause of his death. However, his death certificate stated that he died of respiratory failure and metastatic lung cancer.</p><p>The legendary actor breathed his last at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He is buried in Brownsville Cemetery in West Windsor, Vermont.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>Tendler’s Health Is Also Not In Good Condition</b></h2><p>According to Harriet in an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>WAMG</a>, she has been struggling with her health. She had breast cancer and also lung cancer. In addition, she had three operations to treat a broken femur. However, she is somehow coping with her old days.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>Charles Bronson’s First Wife Harriet Tendler’s Career</b></h2><p>Although Harriet Bronson wanted to become an actress, she ended up as a radio talk show host on Los Angeles radio stations. Before that, she even worked as a shop assistant to support her ex-spouse and children. Because she was busy managing work and children, she never had time to think about a career.</p><p>Nevertheless, she started her profession after her divorce from her ex-husband. Tendler had put her acting career on the back burner to support her ex-partner through a difficult period, but she was betrayed. But, as we say, it’s all for the best, it helped her find her voice and establish her identity.</p><p>She is also an author who has published three books, including her latest, Charlie and Me. According to her, although this book is about her and Charles, it is also about first wives who marry ambitious men. It is about their suffering and the emotional struggle they face.</p><p><b>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Meet Josh Dallas’ Son Oliver Finlay Dallas: Wiki, Age, Parents, & Untold Facts</a></b></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>What Is Harriet’s Net Worth?</b></h2><p>As Harriet has not disclosed her total wealth, we do not know the exact amount of money she earns.
