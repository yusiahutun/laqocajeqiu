He has appeared in several movies since 1979, for example, Iron Man 2 and The Expendables in 2010 and the Immortals in 2011. He started boxing as a teenager, but became a professional much later in 1991, although it has not been continuous.</p><h2>What happened to Mickey Rourke?</h2><p class=align-left>Although Mickey was committed to boxing as a teenager, he fell in love with acting after participating in the play, Deathwatch. He then relocated to New York where he attended the famous Actors Studio.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fb70d55837c39dc2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Physically Challenged Man Given Weeks to Live, Marries Fiancé in Beautiful Beach Wedding: "Love of My Life"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The talented actor has had trouble maintaining success in Hollywood. In the 1980s, Mickey struggled with his flourishing fame. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was involved</a> in scandalous relationships, misused his money, and tainted his name on set for being difficult to work with. He could not keep his attitude in check while on set and has been referred to as a "loose cannon" and a nightmare to work with.</p><p class=align-left>Due to his bad behaviour that made him fall out of favour in Hollywood, Mickey got into a very dark time in his life. He started drinking excessively and his mental health was affected, leading to depression. At one point, he stayed indoors for almost five months and slept in his closet. With his career over, his wife gone, and no money, he only had his dogs. If you check Mickey Rourke Instagram page, you will clearly see that he is a dog lover, and this is because of the loyalty of his pets during his hardest times.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1e34261fc512022f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dreka Gates and Kevin Gates relationship: Everything you should know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Eventually, he went back to his teenage passion, boxing, but unfortunately, he sustained heavy injuries. He triumphantly returned to acting when he starred in the film, The Wrestler, that saw him nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award. Mickey Rourke acting talent has seen him star in several other films (occasionally acting for money), although he has burned some bridges along the way, for his running mouth. He has negatively commented about Marvel and openly criticized some movies that he has acted. His questionable decisions also saw him turn down several high-profile roles in movies like Pulp Fiction, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, and The Silence of the Lambs.</p><h3>Mickey Rourke movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fb70d55837c39dc2.jpg><p class=align-left>Some of his movies include:</p><ul><li>Fade to Black - 1980</li><li>Body Heat - 1981</li><li>Diner by Barry Levinson - 1982</li><li>The Pope of Greenwich Village - 1984</li><li>9½ Weeks - 1986</li><li>Angel Heart - 1987</li><li>White Sands - 1992</li><li>Fall Time - 1995</li><li>Sin City - 2005</li><li>The Wrestler -2008</li><li>Ashby - 2015</li><li>War Pigs -2015</li><li>Weaponized - 2016</li><li>Tiger - 2018</li><li>Berlin, I Love You - 2019</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f3a30113f478899d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of all rappers who died in 2021: From DMX to Biz Markie</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He has won several awards such as</p><ul><li>1983 - Diner - Boston Society of Film Critics Award - Best Supporting Actor</li><li>1991 - Sin City- Chicago Film Critics Association - Best Supporting Actor</li><li>2006 - 9½ Weeks - Golden Orange Award - Honorary Award</li><li>2008 - The Wrestler - San Diego / Toronto / Chicago Film Critics Association - Best Actor</li></ul><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Troy Gentile bio: weightloss, girlfriend family, net worth</p><h2>What happened to Mickey Rourke's face?</h2><p class=align-left>After his issues with acting, Mickey decided to switch to boxing in 1991. He said that he made the switch because he felt that he was self-destructing and had no respect for himself as an actor. Mickey Rourke's boxing career was good, with eight matches undefeated (six wins and two draws). He was an international fighter who fought in countries like Japan, Germany, and Spain.</p><p class=align-left>As is always the case with boxing, injuries are prone. Mickey suffered several injuries such as a broken nose, split tongue, compressed cheekbone, and broke toes and ribs. Short-term loss of memory was also another side effect. Eventually, the injuries were too much and necessitated reconstructive surgery on his face.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f38a8675c7d3c8f0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Good Samaritans Surprise Homeless Man with Fully Equipped Food Truck</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, the surgery did not go well and his features were messed up. As of 2019, he had undergone several procedures to fix his face although they have been overdone to the point of him being almost <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">unrecognizable. </a>Gone is the handsome young face from his younger days.</p><h2>Mickey Rouke wife</h2><p class=align-left>Mickey has been married twice in the past although he has no children. He was married to Debra Feuer in 1981 whom she met while working on the film Hardcase. The marriage lasted until 1989 although they remained good friends. From 1992 through 1998, Mr. Rouke was married to Carré Otis.</p><p class=align-left>He has also been involved with several celebrities such as Sasha Volkova and Terry Farrell. More recently, between 2009 and 2015, he was<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> dating Anastassija Makarenko</a>, a Russian model. Clearly, any rumors of Mickey Rourke gay are not true.</p><h2>Mickey Rourke now</h2><p class=align-left>Is Mickey Rourke still alive? Yes, 67-year-old Mickey is very much alive. Currently, he is back in acting and seems to be doing okay.
